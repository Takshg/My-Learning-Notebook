# Compelling presentation tips

**Key Points:**

- **Data visualization is crucial for effective communication.** Businesses use data to solve problems and achieve goals, but data alone isn't enough. Stakeholders need to understand and stay engaged with the information presented.
- **Effective presentations are logically organized, interesting, and communicate key messages clearly.** They support the narrative and make it more engaging than words alone.
- **A compelling data story needs a clear structure.** This includes characters, setting, plot, big reveal, and "aha moment."
- **Characters are the people affected by the story.** This could be stakeholders, customers, clients, and others. Adding personal accounts and human context to data insights can make the story more relatable.
- **Setting describes the context of the data project.** This includes information about what's happening, how often it's happening, what tasks are involved, and other background information.
- **Plot, or conflict, creates tension in the current situation.** This could be a challenge, an inefficient process, or a new opportunity. It should reveal the problem your analysis is solving and compel the characters to act.
- **Big reveal, or resolution, shows how data can solve the problem.** This could involve becoming more competitive, improving a process, inventing a new system, or achieving the ultimate goal of the data project.
- **"Aha moment" is when you share your recommendations and explain their potential impact.** This is where you convince your audience why your proposed solutions will help the company succeed.
- **Using these elements to outline your presentation can help organize your findings into a clear story.** Once you have the structure, you can focus on creating interesting and persuasive visuals to enhance your narrative.

**Introduction:**

- Themes: These control the overall look and feel of your presentation, including colors, fonts, formatting, and positioning of elements. Choose a theme that aligns with the tone and information you're presenting.
- Titles and Subtitles: Clearly communicate the topic and date of your presentation. Specifying a date provides important context, especially for data that changes over time.
