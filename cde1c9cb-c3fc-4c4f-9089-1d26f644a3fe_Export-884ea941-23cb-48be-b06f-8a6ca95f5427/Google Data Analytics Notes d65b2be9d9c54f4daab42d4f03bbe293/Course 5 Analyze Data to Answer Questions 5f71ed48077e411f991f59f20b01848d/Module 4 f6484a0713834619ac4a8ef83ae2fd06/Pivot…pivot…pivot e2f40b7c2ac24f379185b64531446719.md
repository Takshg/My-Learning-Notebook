# Elements of a pivot table

Previously, you learned that a pivot table is a tool used to sort, reorganize, group, count, total, or average data in spreadsheets. In this reading, you will learn more about the parts of a pivot table and how data analysts use them to summarize data and answer questions about their data.

**Pivot tables** make it possible to view data in multiple ways in order to identify insights and trends. They can help you quickly make sense of larger data sets by comparing metrics, performing calculations, and generating reports. They’re also useful for answering specific questions about your data.

A pivot table has four basic parts: rows, columns, values, and filters.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gzTugf-cSQa07oH_nDkGVw_f31e3c2b726e48d08a61f7d09d93c2f1_Screenshot-2021-07-12-1.20.23-PM-1-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=s_Cn7sc1gvjQSUxJ7MnQQccx1NUiyFho-RwQuJRMfZU)

The **rows** of a pivot table organize and group data you select horizontally. For example, in the [Start working with pivot tables](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analyze-data/lecture/HCOme/start-working-with-pivot-tables) video, the Release Date values were used to create rows that grouped the data by year.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/goLsfckvSv2C7H3JLwr94A_ab77d9d73f9b42809606e30d1ee1bbf1_Screenshot-2021-07-13-8.35.12-AM-1-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=HfjGToWi9Qjk3pjNDW3pCINnABPOQ9EZfvJlE6GuYxo)

The **columns** organize and display values from your data vertically. Similar to rows, columns can be pulled directly from the data set or created using **values**. **Values** are used to calculate and count data. This is where you input the variables you want to measure. This is also how you create calculated fields in your pivot table. As a refresher, a **calculated field** is a new field within a pivot table that carries out certain calculations based on the values of other fields

In the previous movie data example, the **Values** editor created columns for the pivot table, including the **SUM** of Box Office Revenue, the **AVERAGE** of Box Office Revenue, and the **COUNT** of Box Office Revenue columns.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/DF08HQOLQ7CdPB0Di3OwAg_a9918b5905c3410382e10332cbdd55f1_unnamed-16-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=Nje0Q6XWaikf49Eylka2ZrCPyBlhd-lVrFboal0kvnk)

Finally, the **filters** section of a pivot table enables you to apply filters based on specific criteria—just like filters in regular spreadsheets! For example, a filter was added to the movie data pivot table so that it only included movies that generated less than $10 million in revenue.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vbTJ3Q9uRLe0yd0PbpS3vQ_02be9c5b3bfe43efb38cb631210536f1_Screenshot-2021-07-13-9.15.28-AM-1-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=FEbG9PP_6l7in-8DdS7roHKjuTz0F_gAyC73p4o4EmY)

Being able to use all four parts of the pivot table editor will allow you to compare different metrics from your data and execute calculations, which will help you gain valuable insights.

## Using pivot tables for analysis

Pivot tables can be a useful tool for answering specific questions about a dataset so you can quickly share answers with stakeholders. For example, a data analyst working at a department store was asked to determine the total sales for each department and the number of products they each sold. They were also interested in knowing exactly which department generated the most revenue.

Instead of making changes to the original spreadsheet data, they used a pivot table to answer these questions and easily compare the sales revenue and number of products sold by each department.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-VkZUiJoSsmZGVIiaGrJ6Q_a44072b9be354ed0b516e725f29365f1_Screenshot-2021-07-13-11.04.58-AM-1-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=1NWU-lurY10PxZGLrxFjJaFUNYpTrAKOQtEi4letmDY)

They used the department as the rows for this pivot table to group and organize the rest of the sales data. Then, they input two Values as columns: the SUM of sales and a count of the products sold. They also sorted the data by the SUM of sales column in order to determine which department generated the most revenue.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/OKSyrTgRQBiksq04EWAYmw_3f070771a65043dc8a466f2e8053d3f1_Screenshot-2021-07-13-10.45.55-AM-1-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=2KoHzZeluO7qKRKpYp5q1DdZcQsC6-v5eLmt5poIY7E)

Now they know that the Toys department generated the most revenue!

## Key takeaways

Pivot tables are an effective tool for data analysts working with spreadsheets because they highlight key insights from the spreadsheet data without having to make changes to the spreadsheet. Coming up, you will create your own pivot table to analyze data and identify trends that will be highly valuable to stakeholders.

# Use pivot tables in analysis

In this reading, you will learn how to create and use pivot tables for data analysis. You will also get some resources about pivot tables that you can save for your own reference when you start creating pivot tables yourself. **Pivot tables** are a spreadsheet tool that let you view data in multiple ways to find insights and trends.****

Pivot tables allow you to make sense of large data sets by giving you tools to easily compare metrics, quickly perform calculations, and generate readable reports. You can create a pivot table to help you answer specific questions about your data. For example, if you were analyzing sales data, you could use pivot tables to answer questions like, “Which month had the most sales?” and “What products generated the most revenue this year?” When you need answers to questions about your data, pivot tables can help you cut through the clutter and focus on only the data you need.

## Create your pivot table

Before you can analyze data with pivot tables, you will need to create a pivot table with your data. The following includes the steps for creating a pivot table in Google Sheets, but most spreadsheet programs will have similar tools.

First, you will open the **Insert** menu from the toolbar; there will be an option for **Pivot table**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Vihv6AQURV6ob-gEFLVeYw_69da1b9f3d0b442d8db69afc0af1e6f1_Screenshot-2022-04-27-7.40.15-AM.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=psyvxPQlidWv3Axuw21NM28-GTxPUEp7zhbxsX1ti0c)

This pop-up menu will appear:

There is an option to select New sheet or Existing sheet and a Create button

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/O5Foq0BySvCRaKtActrwGg_9ff0b1fdbf8046398c7ee2d5abdc2044_Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-11.47.45-AM.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=TTmZwhQiCpsKjJ4cvs5xYh6JstZqYa5rklo-sb4FyAE)

Generally, you will want to create a new sheet for your pivot table to keep your raw data and your analysis separate. You can also store all of your calculations in one place for easy reference. Once you have created your pivot table, there will be a pivot table editor that you can access to the right of your data.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nY3EyYVbTViNxMmFWy1YVQ_667552fecaa54c25b60ece296375708c_unnamed-2-.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=t02t33DktPHd8J4diJTOXap1h2n_AyoE-WeRaeH2kds)

This is where you will be able to customize your pivot table, including what variables you want to include for your analysis.

# **Step 2: Create Your Pivot Table**

For this exercise, you will use Google Sheets to work with pivot tables. If you are using Excel, the interface might be different. However, the majority of the functions are similar.

First, you need to generate your pivot table:

1. Open the Movie Data Starter Project spreadsheet.

2. Navigate to the **Movie Data** sheet.

3. With your cursor in a non-blank field, select the **Insert** menu.

4. Select **Pivot Table**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9nDWhUuyQD6-6G_2qrW9og_3eff16549588413686725c9a7eb133e1_C5M4L2_01.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=mting5OYnhVuYUgX_F-WUdI5haXXuqPhRHhBQ6KX84E)

5. Verify the following **Create pivot table** settings:

a. Data range **= 'Movie Data'!A1:N509**

b. Insert to **= New Sheet**

6. Select **Create**.

7. In the newly created sheet, right-select on the tab and select **Rename** to rename the sheet to Summary.

8. Now, your Pivot table editor is likely going to be open on the right side of the screen.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vt6d9l_nQxC0IndFo21EBw_0cea0c85f40740d1ad9a89ac9f5d1be1_C5M4L2_02.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=l-l9tuHmv94xxv4jsQty55AC1jzI1G5ztpuSn-JjevU)

If the Pivot table editor isn’t already open, move your cursor over the pivot table area to reveal a small green pencil **Edit** icon. Select it to open the **Pivot table editor**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qGbT_CwJTfCFbU7DIliI7A_30c158f336fd43d191b454bde03d43e1_C5M4L2_03.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=TK1JeXgxFHfAZwL8JIFbTTAgRCZe-ihopRdLpVVhxJc)

# **Step 3: Find the Average Amount of Money Movies Make in Each Genre**

In the Pivot table editor:

1. Select on the **Add** button to the right of the **Rows** section.

2. Select **Genre (1)**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jLLOmZ5yREy5t6FMDvjT3w_34f6634737ff4d2a8d8250ebc976c5e1_C5M4L2_04.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=Gly-mOnBQXzmBAB9vFW12EEy5kdQJykyZOppfaRF8Ig)

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/D0idjWeqSrCWQLMEBC9aUQ_f689fe490bd74d11af3f1174c8b027e1_C5M4L2_05.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=vJTn4XzSfLeOO58k-11XIxs-pAookzfCH4sw4512iJE)

3. Next, select on the **Add** button to the right of the Values section.

4. Select **Box Office Revenue ($)**.

5. In that smaller box, change the **Summarize by** selection by using the dropdown and changing the summarization from **SUM** to **AVERAGE**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/DREb-Pz0RY2wfALVzMbdXg_c34a49c0c8834cdb9698b5d3a26ab8e1_C5M4L2_06.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=8nzTGIGYqTghkB-HnAPYcjcSOHEJWPgPIxrhZCbmyMg)

Now you have the breakdown of Average Box Office Revenue ($) by Genre.

# **Step 4: Find the Average Amount of Money Spent on a Movie in Each Genre**

Now, investigate the budget of these movies so you can compare them to the revenue you just calculated and determine their profit. Repeat the previous process to find the Budget ($):

1. Select on the **Add** button to the right of the **Values** section.

2. Select **Budget ($)**.

3. In that smaller box, change the **Summarize by** selection by using the dropdown and changing the summarization from **SUM** to **AVERAGE**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7yxBODEqSrKQT2t4dik2xw_bdcb587bee534906a0e4c0f0888d27e1_C5M4L2_07.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=cqV6a-X4CSzFUMSdF_m8EWxYd1WTiYgVpKLi9paVP6E)

Now you have the average revenue and budget broken down by genre.

# **Step 5: [Optional] Find the Genre that is Most Profitable on Average**

**Note:** You may not be able to complete this part of the activity in Microsoft Excel. If you’re completing this activity in Microsoft Excel and do not find a **Custom** option in step 5.4, move on to step 6, complete the activity in Google Sheets, or use the resources provided earlier in this lesson to complete this step.

You can also use pivot tables to calculate profitability directly in the pivot table:

1. Select the **Add** button to the right of the **Values** section.

2. Select **Calculated Field**.

3. Copy and paste the following into the **formula**:

**=AVERAGE('Box Office Revenue ($)')-AVERAGE('Budget ($)')**

4. Change the **Summarize by** selection from **SUM** to **Custom**.

5. Select on cell **D1** (in your Summary tab) and enter **Average Profit** to rename the newly calculated field.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mA2vnLAcSDG0ujAU30SJ8A_b431c37cb2924335a6700b3130a163e1_C5M4L2_08.png?expiry=1716940800000&hmac=Jp0T3XQcZGiCeykkhMpjqVt27_wsZ2mPSvKmvnlWgag)

Perhaps your manager also asks you if there’s any way to sort the sheet to make it easier to identify which genres are most profitable. To do that, follow these steps:

6. In the Pivot table editor, go to the **Genre (1)** in your rows and update these settings:

a. For the **Sort by** dropdown, change the value from **Genre (1)** to **Average Profit**.

b. For the **Order** dropdown, change the value from **Ascending** to **Descending**.

Here is that pivot table, now sorted to have the most profitable genres as the top of the list!

# **Step 6: Visualize Your Data**

Tables provide useful information, but visualizations can be even more effective for communicating data insights.

1. Select any cell in your pivot table.

2. Navigate to the **Insert** menu.

3. Select **Chart**.

This creates a chart in the same worksheet as your pivot table.

4. Now, move the chart to the side of your table:

a. Select the **chart**.

b. Left-select in the chart and—while holding down your cursor—drag the **cursor** next to your table. This should move the chart with the movement of your cursor.

5. Next, set up your chart.

a. In the chart editor, navigate to **Setup**.

b. In the **Setup** window, change the **Chart Type** to **Bar chart**.

c. Under **Series**, select on the three dots to the right of **AVERAGE of Budget ($)**.

d. Select **Remove**.

e. Next, under **Series**, select the three dots to the right of **AVERAGE of Profit**.

f. Select **Remove**.

6. Next, customize your chart.

a. In the chart editor, navigate to **Customize**.

b. Under **Chart & Axis Titles**, select **Chart title**.

c. Change the chart title to **Average of Box Office Revenue ($) by Genre**.

Great work! Now you have a visual of box office revenue by genre.

7. The graph you created displays genre in alphabetical order. However, if you're interested in knowing which genre garners the highest average box office revenue ($), you'll want to sort the data from highest to lowest. You can do that by sorting the information in the pivot table. To do this:

a. Open the Pivot table editor.

b. In the Pivot table editor, go to the **Genre (1)** in your rows and update these settings:

1. For the **Sort by** dropdown, select **Average of Box Office Revenue ($)**.
2. For the **Order** dropdown, select **Descending**.

**Note:** You may have noticed that there may be a **Grand Total**, which doesn’t appear to fall into the middle of your sorting. That’s okay! This is because it’s the total across all genres. You can choose to remove this by going back into your pivot table editor, in your Rows section, uncheck the **Show totals** box. This should automatically update any other references (charts or other) that were pointed at your pivot table!
