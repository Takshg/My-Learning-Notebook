# Explore data analyst tools

- **Spreadsheet**: Is a digital worksheet,  It stores, organizes, and sorts data.
    - This is important because the usefulness of your data depends on how well it's structured.
    - When you put your data into a spreadsheet, you can see patterns, group information and easily find the information you need.
    - Spreadsheets also have some really useful features called formulas and functions.
    - **Formula**: is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet.
        - Formulas can do basic things like add, subtract, multiply and divide, but they don't stop there.
        - You can also use formulas to find the average of a number set.
        - Look up a particular value, return the sum of a set of values that meets a particular rule, and so much more.
    - **Function**: is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet.
        - Just think of a function as a simpler, more efficient way of doing something that would normally take a lot of time. In other words, functions can help make you more efficient.
- The next data analysis tool is called query language.
    - **Query language**: is a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database.
    - You'll learn something called structured query language, more commonly known as SQL.
        - SQL is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database.
        - A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. SQL is the most widely used structured query language for a couple of reasons. It's easy to understand and works very well with all kinds of databases.
        - With SQL, data analysts can access the data they need by making a query.
        - Although query means question, I like to think of it as more of a request. So you're requesting that the database do something for you.
        - You can ask it to do a lot of different things such as insert, delete, select or update data.
- Lastly, let's talk about data visualization.
    - You've learned that data visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, and tables.
    - Most people process visuals more easily than words alone. That's why visualizations are so important. They help data analysts communicate their insights to others, in an effective and compelling way.
    - When you think about the data analysis process, after data is prepared, processed and analyzed, the insights are visualized so it can be understood and shared. This makes it easier for stakeholders to draw conclusions, make decisions, and come up with strategies.
    - Some popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.
        - Data analysts like using Tableau because it helps them create visuals that are very easy to understand. This means that even non-technical users can get the information they need.
        - Looker is also popular with data analysts because it gives them an easy way to create visuals based on the results of a query. With Looker, you can give stakeholders a complete picture of your work by showing them visualization data and the actual data related to it.
    - All visualization tools have great features that are useful in different situations.

# Choose the right tool for the job

- As a data analyst, you will usually have to decide which program or solution is right for the particular project you are working on. In this reading, you will learn more about how to choose which tool you need and when.
- Depending on which phase of the data analysis process you’re in, you will need to use different tools.
    - For example, if you are focusing on creating complex and eye-catching visualizations, then the visualization tools we discussed earlier are the best choice.
    - But if you are focusing on organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, then you will probably be choosing between spreadsheets and databases using queries. Spreadsheets and databases both offer ways to store, manage, and use data. The basic content for both tools are sets of values. Yet, there are some key differences, too:
        
        
        | **Spreadsheets** | **Databases** |
        | --- | --- |
        | Accessed through a software application | Database accessed using a query language |
        | Structured data in a row and column format | Structured data using rules and relationships |
        | Organizes information in cells | Organizes information in complex collections |
        | Provides access to a limited amount of data | Provides access to huge amounts of data |
        | Manual data entry | Strict and consistent data entry |
        | Generally one user at a time | Multiple users |
        | Controlled by the user | Controlled by a database management system |
- You don’t have to choose one or the other because each serves its own purpose. Generally, data analysts work with a combination of the two, as both tools are very useful in data analytics.
    - For example, you can store data in a database, then export it to a spreadsheet for analysis.
    - Or, if you are collecting information in a spreadsheet, and it becomes too much for that particular platform, you can import it into a database.
    - And, later in this course, you will learn about programming languages like R that give you even greater control of your data, its analysis, and the visualizations you create.

## Key takeaways

- The choice of data analysis tools depends on the specific task at hand. Spreadsheets are suitable for organizing, cleaning, and analyzing small to medium datasets. Databases are ideal for storing, managing, and analyzing large and complex datasets. Data analysts often use a combination of spreadsheets, databases, and programming languages to effectively handle a wide range of data analysis tasks.
