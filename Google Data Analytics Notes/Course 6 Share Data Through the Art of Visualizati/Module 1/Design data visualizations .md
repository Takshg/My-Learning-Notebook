- **Data visualization is an art form:** Data analysts and artists use similar elements to create effective and compelling visuals.
- **Elements of art in data visualization:**
    - **Line:** Can be curved or straight, thick or thin, and used to add structure and form to data.
    - **Shape:** Should be two-dimensional for clarity and can be used to create contrast and highlight specific data points.
    - **Color:** Defined by hue, intensity, and value. Value is particularly important for drawing attention to specific areas.
    - **Space:** The area between, around, and in objects. Too much or too little space can detract from the visualization.
    - **Movement:** Used sparingly to create a sense of flow or action. Can be distracting if overused.

**Definitions:**

- **Data visualization:** The process of representing data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps.
- **Elements of art:** The basic building blocks of art, including line, shape, color, space, and movement.
- **Hue:** The name of a color, such as red, green, or blue.
- **Intensity:** The brightness or dullness of a color.
- **Value:** The lightness or darkness of a color.
- **Shades:** Dark values with black added.
- **Tints:** Light values with white added.

# Principles of design

In this reading, you are going to learn more about using the elements of art and principles of design to create effective visualizations. So far, we have learned that communicating data visually is a form of art. Now, it's time to explore the nine design principles for creating beautiful and effective data visualizations that can be informative and appeal to all audiences.

After we go through the various design principles, spend some time examining the visual examples to ensure that you have a thorough understanding of how the principle is put into practice. Let’s get into it!

## Nine basic principles of design

There are nine ****basic **principles of design** that data analysts should think about when building their visualizations.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mn0oQGvPS2K9KEBrz8tidQ_a674eeba5224451db6df1c973e41d44b_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.20.16-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=Vk9BRkotRaWsfRe8PgKusXVmvGfRZUSLXEU7-yFOIzo)

**1. Balance**: The design of a data visualization is balanced when the key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly. This doesn’t mean that you need complete symmetry, but your visualization shouldn’t have one side distracting from the other. If your data visualization is balanced, this could mean that the lines used to create the graphics are similar in length on both sides, or that the space between objects is equal. For example, [**this column chart**](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart) (also shown below) is balanced; even though the columns are different heights and the chart isn’t symmetrical, the colors, width, and spacing of the columns keep this data visualization balanced. The colors provide sufficient contrast to each other so that you can pay attention to both the motivation level and the energy level displayed.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bqmDqhCfRJipg6oQn0SYBw_d6d283ffacab4c5a83a484cb5e6ac4ac_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-4.11.09-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=r1_GIMnepDtEHt7RHjGiNUeZcfA-EEUCnj74thYzsP4)

**2. Emphasis:** Your data visualization should have a focal point, so that your audience knows where to concentrate. In other words, your visualizations should emphasize the most important data so that users recognize it first. Using color and value is one effective way to make this happen. By using contrasting colors, you can make certain that graphic elements—and the data shown in those elements—stand out.

For example, you will notice a heat map data visualization below from [**The Pudding’s “Where Slang Comes From"](https://pudding.cool/2017/02/new-slang/)** article. This heat map uses colors and value intensity to emphasize the states where search interest is highest. You can visually identify the increase in the search over time from low interest to high interest. This way, you are able to quickly grasp the key idea being presented without knowing the specific data values.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/oBHz_WbkRp6R8_1m5CaecA_5347b07316cc4bcaba3f9265be1230bd_Screen-Shot-2021-03-29-at-7.39.32-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=Mn9_I4usGam2R0y4mY93oOamW5cajGRZGIfHi_anilg)

**3. Movement:** Movement can refer to the path the viewer’s eye travels as they look at a data visualization, or literal movement created by animations. Movement in data visualization should mimic the way people usually read. You can use lines and colors to pull the viewer’s attention across the page.

For example, notice how the average line in [**this combo chart**](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/combochart) (also shown below) draws your attention from left to right. Even though this example isn’t moving, it still uses the movement principle to guide viewers’ understanding of the data.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/p1hhdnUQQ7uYYXZ1EOO76g_e96125cf0ebf4b0e8e4c31e357cd2194_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-4.12.29-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=YZ0oA-Isqw39h6PI754gcqxkk4ECjPSmw6Ke7FmKSoQ)

**4. Pattern:** You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization. This can be useful in a lot of different ways. For example, you can use patterns to highlight similarities between different data sets, or break up a pattern with a unique shape, color, or line to create more emphasis.

In the example below, the different colored categories of [**this stacked column chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart)** (also shown below) ****are a consistent pattern that makes it easier to compare book sales by genre in each column. Notice in the chart that the Fantasy & Sci Fi category (royal blue) is increasing over time even as the general category (green) is staying about the same.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/2H6ZIpq0R-y-mSKatKfsuQ_268ae7d3d10049419721b4cb52a9375f_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-4.13.08-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=xtbgnnvjPYhRCJDURct20EXo3_1Phj6BcWx8-ohhlOI)

**5. Repetition:** Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization. Think about the book sales chart from the previous example: the repetition of the colors helps the audience understand that there are distinct sets of data. You may notice this repetition in all of the examples we have reviewed so far. Take some time to review each of the previous examples and notice the elements that are repeated to create a meaningful visual story.

**6. Proportion:** Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data. Using various colors and sizes helps demonstrate that you are calling attention to a specific visual over others. If you make one chart in a dashboard larger than the others, then you are calling attention to it. It is important to make sure that each chart accurately reflects and visualizes the relationship among the values in it. In [**this dashboard**](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/controls) (also shown below), the slice sizes and colors of the pie chart compared to the data in the table help make the number of donuts eaten by each person the focal point.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/W-CTuFxISVigk7hcSJlYLQ_f516a6799c194f71a706ab727167e28a_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-4.13.44-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=ngVc_N3hudCNqFY1a0ji_mEbd31maK7nr3vp2CgxzfU)

These first six principles of design are key considerations that you can make while you are creating your data visualization. These next three principles are useful checks once your data visualization is finished. If you have applied the initial six principles thoughtfully, then you will probably recognize these next three principles within your visualizations already.

**7. Rhythm:** This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization. Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle. If your finished design doesn’t successfully create a flow, you might want to rearrange some of the elements to improve the rhythm.

**8. Variety:** Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use. Variety keeps the audience engaged. But it is good to find balance since too much variety can confuse people. The variety you include should make your dashboards and other visualizations feel interesting and unified.

**9. Unity:** The last principle is unity. This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive. If the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming.

Being a data analyst means learning to think in a lot of different ways. These nine principles of design can help guide you as you create effective and interesting visualizations.

# Data is beautiful

At this point, you might be asking yourself: What makes a good visualization? Is it the data you use? Or maybe it is the story that it tells? In this reading, you are going to learn more about what makes data visualizations successful by exploring David McCandless’ elements of successful data visualization and evaluating three examples based on those elements. Data visualization can change our perspective and allow us to notice data in new, beautiful ways. A picture is worth a thousand words—that’s true in data too! You will have the option to save all of the data visualization examples that are used throughout this reading; these are great examples of successful data visualization that you can use for future inspiration.

Where just two or three ovals overlap, there are different types of incomplete data visualization. At the center, where all four overlap, contains the words “successful visualization”. This visualization stresses the idea that all four elements are necessary to create a successful data visualization

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9uQ2-C0ITLikNvgtCNy44g_62b8f3cdf2c24b4a9512e77f4d602939_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.03.08-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=73LqItq-Khilju6vxG7TobBnHy0kmXL_ONlcjm5Zoww)

## Four elements of successful visualizations

The Venn diagram by David McCandless identifies four elements of successful visualizations:

- **Information (data):** The information or data that you are trying to convey is a key building block for your data visualization. Without information or data, you cannot communicate your findings successfully.
- **Story (concept):** Story allows you to share your data in meaningful and interesting ways. Without a story, your visualization is informative, but not really inspiring.
- **Goal (function):** The goal of your data visualization makes the data useful and usable. This is what you are trying to achieve with your visualization. Without a goal, your visualization might still be informative, but can’t generate actionable insights.
- **Visual form (metaphor):** The visual form element is what gives your data visualization structure and makes it beautiful. Without visual form, your data is not visualized yet.

All four of these elements are important on their own, but a successful data visualization balances all four. For example, if your data visualization has only two elements, like the information and story, you have a rough outline. This can be really useful in your early planning stages, but is not polished or informative enough to share. Even three elements are not quite enough—you need to consider all four to create a successful data visualization.

In the next part of this reading, you will use these elements to examine two data visualization examples and evaluate why they are successful.

## Example 1: Visualization of dog breed comparison

It uses two axes, popularity and data score, to place different dog breeds on a four-square chart. The squares are labelled “Inexplicably Overrated,” “The Rightly Ignored,” “Hot Dogs!,” and “Overlooked Treasures.” Different dog breeds, visualized with plotted points shaped like dogs, are distributed on the chart based on their popularity and their data score.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6afFrxbJTmWnxa8WyR5lFQ_e808d49c36c54a23807d9a4e72a2f62f_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.09.53-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=bEZB9y762WrsZVs_SGnQxD8rGcgMbJwUnZvNZNu7P-U)

### **Examine the four elements**

This visualization compares the popularity of different dog breeds to a more objective data score. Consider how it uses the elements of successful data visualization:

- **Information (data):** If you view the data, you can explore the metrics being illustrated in the visualization.
- **Story (concept):** The visualization shows which dogs are overrated, which are rightly ignored, and those that are really hot dogs! And, the visualization reveals some overlooked treasures you may not have known about previously.
- **Goal (function):** The visualization is interested in exploring the relationship between popularity and the objective data scores for different dog breeds. By comparing these data points, you can learn more about how different dog breeds are perceived.
- **Visual form (metaphor):** In addition to the actual four-square structure of this visualization, other visual cues are used to communicate information about the dataset. The most obvious is that the data points are represented as dog symbols. Further, the size of a dog symbol and the direction the dog symbol faces communicate other details about the data.

## Example 2: Visualization of rising sea levels

demonstrates how much sea levels are projected to rise over the course of 8,000 years. On the y-axis, it lists both the number of years and the sea level in meters. From right to left, starting with the lowest sea level, the chart includes silhouettes of different cities around the world to demonstrate how long it would take for most of the world to be underwater. It also includes inset maps of the continents and how they would appear at different times as sea levels continue to rise.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/awO5nXmjRIiDuZ15o5SIOw_677bc464f8da478cb3893e12682d652c_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.11.28-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=3ECZmM-zOR6zmUjw5R1dEGTxNOPm4Ww784JK7D_P0KM)

### **Examine the four elements**

This When Sea Levels Attack visualization illustrates how much sea levels are projected to rise over the course of 8,000 years. The silhouettes of different cities with different sea levels, rising from right to left, helps to drive home how much of the world will be affected as sea levels continue to rise. Here is how this data visualization stacks up using the four elements of successful visualization:

- **Information (data):** This visualization uses climate data on rising sea levels from a variety of sources, including NASA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In addition to that data, it also uses recorded sea levels from around the world to help illustrate how much rising sea levels will affect the world.
- **Story (concept):** The visualization tells a very clear story: Over the course of 8,000 years, much of the world as we know it will be underwater.
- **Goal (function):** The goal of this project is to demonstrate how soon rising sea levels are going to affect us on a global scale. Using both data and the visual form, this visualization makes rising sea levels feel more real to the audience.
- **Visual form (metaphor):** The city silhouettes in this visualization are a beautiful way to drive home the point of the visualization. It gives the audience a metaphor for how rising sea levels will affect the world around them in a way that showing just the raw numbers can’t do. And for a more global perspective, the visualization also uses inset maps.

## Key takeaways

Notice how each of these visualizations balance all four elements of successful visualization. They clearly incorporate data, use storytelling to make that data meaningful, focus on a specific goal, and structure the data with visual forms to make it beautiful and communicative. The more you practice thinking about these elements, the more you will be able to include them in your own data visualizations.

# Design thinking and visualizations

**Key Points:**

- **Design thinking** is a user-centric approach to problem-solving that can be applied to data visualization.
- **Empathize:** Understand the needs and emotions of your target audience.
- **Define:** Identify the audience's needs, problems, and your insights.
- **Ideate:** Brainstorm potential data visualization solutions.
- **Prototype:** Create drafts of your visualizations.
- **Test:** Show your visualizations to others and gather feedback.

**Definitions:**

- **Data visualization:** The process of representing data in a visual format.
- **User-centric:** Focused on the needs and wants of the user.
- **Stakeholders:** People who have an interest in the outcome of a project.
- **Color vision deficiencies:** Conditions that make it difficult to distinguish between certain colors.
- **Dashboard:** A visual display of data that provides an overview of a particular topic.

**Summary:**

This video discusses how design thinking can be used to create effective data visualizations. The video begins by explaining what design thinking is and how it can be applied to data visualization. It then goes on to discuss the five phases of design thinking: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The video concludes by discussing the importance of keeping your audience in mind throughout the design process.

# Design thinking for visualization improvement

Design thinking for data visualization involves five phases:

1. **Empathize:** Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualization
2. **Define:** Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data
3. **Ideate:** Generating ideas for data visualization
4. **Prototype:** Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
5. **Test:** Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

As interactive dashboards become more popular for data visualization, new importance has been placed on efficiency and user-friendliness. In this reading, you will learn how design thinking can improve an interactive dashboard. As a junior analyst, you wouldn’t be expected to create an interactive dashboard on your own, but you can use design thinking to suggest ways that developers can improve data visualizations and dashboards.

## An example: online banking dashboard

Suppose you are an analyst at a bank that has just released a new dashboard in their online banking application. This section describes how you might explore this dashboard like a new user would, consider a user’s needs, and come up with ideas to improve data visualization in the dashboard. The dashboard in the banking application has the following data visualization elements:

- Monthly spending is shown as a donut chart that reflects different categories like utilities, housing, transportation, education, and groceries.
- When customers set a budget for a category, the donut chart shows filled and unfilled portions in the same view.
- Customers can also set an overall spending limit, and the dashboard will automatically assign the budgeted amounts (unfilled areas of the donut chart) to each category based on past spending trends.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_0uqO8V9Tg-LqjvFfS4PcQ_844751ba1a91450fb012b628bc8dd853_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.26.55-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=WYgWPy60FGS1yLc7KjWF-s92XpN10cA8qNPJBGgdW4w)

### **Empathize**

First, empathize by putting yourself in the shoes of a customer who has a checking account with the bank.

- Do the colors and labels make sense in the visualization?
- How easy is it to set or change a budget?
- When you click on a spending category in the donut chart, are the transactions in the category displayed?

What is the main purpose of the data visualization? If you answered that it was to help customers stay within budget or to save money, you are right! Saving money was a top customer need for the dashboard.

### **Define**

Now, imagine that you are helping dashboard designers define other things that customers might want to achieve besides saving money.

What other data visualizations might be needed?

- Track income (in addition to spending).
- Track other spending that doesn’t neatly fit into the set categories (this is sometimes called **discretionary spending**).
- Pay off debt.

Can you think of anything else?

### **Ideate**

Next, ideate additional features for the dashboard and share them with the software development team.

- What new data visualizations would help customers?
- Would you recommend bar charts or line charts in addition to the standard donut chart?
- Would you recommend allowing users to create their own (custom) categories?

Can you think of anything else?

### **Prototype**

Finally, developers can prototype the next version of the dashboard with new and improved data visualizations.

### **Test**

Developers can close the cycle by having you (and others) test the prototype before it is sent to stakeholders for review and approval.

## Key takeaways

This design thinking example showed how important it is to:

- Understand the needs of users.
- Generate new ideas for data visualizations.
- Make incremental improvements to data visualizations over time.
