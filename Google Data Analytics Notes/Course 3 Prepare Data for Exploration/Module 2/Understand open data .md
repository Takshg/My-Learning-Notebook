# Features of open data

## **Open Data**

- **Definition:** Free access, usage, and sharing of data.
- **Key Points:**
    - Doesn't ignore other data ethics concerns (ownership, transparency, consent, currency, privacy).
    - Must be available as a whole, preferably by downloading over the Internet in a convenient and modifiable form.
    - Must be provided under terms that allow reuse and redistribution, including the ability to use it with other datasets.
    - Everyone must be able to use, reuse, and redistribute the data. No discrimination against fields, persons, or groups.

### **Benefits of Open Data**

- **Wider use of credible databases.**
- **Leveraging, sharing, and combining data with other data.**
- **Impact on scientific collaboration, research advances, analytical capacity, and decision-making.**
- **Examples:**
    - **Human health:** Access and combine diverse data to detect diseases earlier.
    - **Government:** Hold leaders accountable and provide better access to community services.

### **Challenges of Open Data**

- **Technological shift required.**
- **Interoperability is key:** Ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data.
- **Example:** Health care information systems where multiple organizations need to access and share data to ensure patients get the care they need.
- **Requires cooperation.**

### **Future of Open Data**

- **Depends on addressing challenges effectively.**
- **Potential for open, timely, fair, and simple sharing of data.**

## **Key Takeaways**

- Open data is a powerful tool with the potential to transform society and decision-making.
- It's important to consider data ethics concerns even with open data.
- Open data requires technological and cooperative efforts to be successful.

## **Definitions**

- **Open data:** Data that is freely available to everyone to use and reuse.
- **Interoperability:** The ability of different systems and services to communicate and share data with each other.
- **Data ethics:** The principles that guide how data should be collected, used, and shared.

# The open data debate

- Just like data privacy, open data is a widely debated topic in today’s world.
- Data analysts think a lot about open data, and as a future data analyst, you need to understand the basics to be successful in your new role.

## What is open data?

- In data analytics, **open data** is part of **data ethics,** which has to do with using data ethically. **Openness** refers to free access, usage, and sharing of data. But for data to be considered open, it has to:
    - Be available and accessible to the public as a complete dataset
    - Be provided under terms that allow it to be reused and redistributed
    - Allow universal participation so that anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data
- Data can only be considered open when it meets all three of these standards.

## The open data debate: What data should be publicly available?

- One of the biggest benefits of open data is that credible databases can be used more widely.
    - Basically, this means that all of that good data can be leveraged, shared, and combined with other data.
    - This could have a huge impact on scientific collaboration, research advances, analytical capacity, and decision-making. But it is important to think about the individuals being represented by the public, open data, too.
- **Third-party data** is collected by an entity that doesn’t have a direct relationship with the data. You might remember learning about this type of data earlier.
    - For example, third parties might collect information about visitors to a certain website. Doing this lets these third parties create audience profiles, which helps them better understand user behavior and target them with more effective advertising.
- **Personal identifiable information (PII)** is data that is reasonably likely to identify a person and make information known about them. It is important to keep this data safe***.*** PII can include a person’s address, credit card information, social security number, medical records, and more.
- Everyone wants to keep personal information about themselves private. Because third-party data is readily available, it is important to balance the openness of data with the privacy of individuals.

# Steps for ethical data use

### **Key Points**

- **Data analysts play a crucial role in ensuring ethical data use.** They bridge the gap between technology development and informed decision-making.
- **Self-reflection is essential.** Consider the impact of your work and question your assumptions. Who are you building for? Who is represented in the data? Who is not?
- **Be aware of the potential harms and risks associated with data analysis.** What are the consequences of keeping the data? How can it be misused?
- **Obtain informed consent from individuals whose data you are collecting.** Communicate clearly how the data will be used and provide channels for communication.
- **Consider the ethical implications of how you present your findings.** How will the results be used? Who will see them? What are the potential consequences?
- **Data analysts have a significant impact on the responsible use of data.** They can help ensure that technology benefits everyone and minimizes harm.

### **Definitions**

- **Data ethics:** The study of the moral and social implications of data collection, analysis, and use.
- **Informed consent:** Permission granted by an individual after they have been informed of the purpose and potential risks of data collection.
- **Data representation:** The extent to which different groups of people are included in a dataset.
- **Data integrity:** The accuracy and completeness of data.
- **Data quality:** The overall fitness of data for its intended use.

# Hands-On Activity: Kaggle datasets

## Activity overview

In the last activity, you got set up on Kaggle and explored the Notebooks feature. In this activity, we will work with a different feature of the Kaggle platform: datasets.

Kaggle has tens of thousands of datasets that are available for public use. Anyone can upload a dataset to Kaggle. If they choose to make it public, other Kagglers can use that dataset to create their own projects.

First, you’ll take a tour of a specific dataset. Then, you’ll have a chance to choose your own datasets to work with. Finally, you’ll use what you’ve learned in this module to determine the kind of data in your datasets, and whether the data is biased or unbiased.

By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to use many of the helpful features Kaggle has to offer. This will enable you to find data for projects and engage with the data community, which is important for developing skills and networking in your career as a data analyst.

## Explore Kaggle datasets

Let’s explore the datasets feature!

### Find a dataset

1. To start, log in to your Kaggle account.

- **Note:** Kaggle frequently updates its user interface. The latest changes may not be reflected in the screenshots, but the principles in this activity remain the same. Adapting to changes in software updates is an essential skill for data analysts, and we encourage you to practice troubleshooting. You can also reach out to your community of learners on the discussion forum for help.

2. Then, click on the **Datasets** icon in the vertical **Navigation** bar on the left. This takes you to the **Datasets** home page. From here, you can create a new dataset or search for datasets created by other Kagglers.

3. Now, check out a specific dataset. Enter **Animal Crossing** in the search bar to find datasets related to the Nintendo video game *Animal Crossing*.

4. There’s more than one option, so click on the **Animal Crossing New Horizons Catalog.** This takes you to the landing page for this dataset.

### Tour a dataset landing page

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/yCVz-d-8TDClc_nfvFwwWw_40b2e2ec97db44d0b9011f3f31442af1_Screenshot-2022-03-04-9.42.50-AM.png?expiry=1716681600000&hmac=QsjQAuZ1ZJ1yjumIj2b1_Ess00J6WZS37GBaOBThpU4)

**Header:** The header at the top of the page contains the following information about the dataset:

- Its title
- A brief description of its contents
- The name of its creator
- When it was last updated
- Its current version

**Badge:**  In the top-right corner of the header, you’ll find three more items:

- A badge in the shape of a circle
- An icon in the shape of a caret symbol ( ^ )
- A number

The badge is related to Kaggle’s progression system. If you want, you can read more about it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/progression/).

**Upvotes:** Clicking on the caret lets you “upvote” the dataset. The number shows the number of times this dataset has been upvoted by the Kaggle community.

**Tabs:** Beneath the header is a bar with three tabs: Data Card, Code, and Discussion. Take a moment to click on each of these tabs and explore their contents. Afterwards, navigate back to the Datasets tab!

Now, you can move down the page. You’ll find a box that contains three terms: **Usability, License,** and **Tags.**

**Usability** shows how complete the dataset *webpage* is (and not the dataset itself). Kaggle encourages the community to add information to the dataset webpage to make the dataset itself easier to understand. For example, a brief description or a column header. Hover your cursor over the **Usability score** to discover what the dataset page contains.

**Licenses** govern how a dataset can be used. Click on the **license name** to learn more about that specific license.

**Expected update frequency** will report when the data set was updated with new attributes, amendments, or expansions of the data. You may also see when any expected future dates are scheduled for a data set update. In this case, there will never be an update scheduled.

The next box down contains a detailed description of the dataset. Kagglers often include information on where the dataset came from and how the dataset was prepared.

And last—but certainly not least—is the Data Explorer!

## Use the data explorer

The **Data Explorer** menu shows that the *Animal Crossing* dataset contains 30 .csv files. If you click on a file name, the window to the right will display information from that specific file. Try clicking on **umbrellas.csv** to check it out!

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0AoU2H7GSkyKFNh-xspMuA_2aefbfa184fa42019199764ba9b6ebf1_Screenshot-2022-03-04-9.59.29-AM.png?expiry=1716681600000&hmac=L89qeiTTujMIWqvlKRPTE9-QRUIfKge_XhG6fDCSQy4)

### Tour the dataset explorer

Notice that the Data Explorer has three viewing options: **Detail, Compact,** and **Column.** For now, we’ll focus on the **Detail** tab.

The description at the top of the **Detail** tab shows that the umbrellas.csv file contains data on all the umbrellas in the video game. Let’s check out the columns. Each column header has three items:

- A small icon on the left that shows the data type
- The name of the column
- An icon with three bars that lets you sort the data if you click on it

Below each column header is a box that contains a summary of the data. This lets you quickly get an idea of what’s in the dataset. For example, the summary for the **Name** column shows there are 67 unique values for the umbrella names. The summary for the **DIY** column shows that 9 of the umbrella recipes are DIY, or “do it yourself.” Take a moment to explore the summaries for the other columns.

And that completes our tour! That’s a lot of information. Feel free to go back and review.

## Access a dataset

After you’ve explored a dataset, you can link it to a Kaggle notebook or download it to access it for your own use. Linking a dataset to a Kaggle notebook means you create a new notebook from the existing dataset so that it is available for you to use.

### Find your own datasets

Now, you’ll get a chance to choose your own datasets to work with! Use the following steps to find datasets that interest you:

1. When you’re ready, click on the **Data** icon on the left to return to the **Datasets** landing page.

2. Note that datasets can exist in a variety of formats. If you want to make sure your dataset is in a .csv format, click on the **Filter** button on the right side of the Datasets search bar. Then, choose **CSV** from the menu.

3. Find 2-3 datasets that you’re interested in exploring further.

4. Create notebooks from them, download them, or check them out in the Data Explorer. Keep these datasets in mind for your upcoming reflection.

### Link or download a dataset

Here are the options to create a notebook or download the dataset:

- Create a Kaggle notebook: To link a dataset to a Kaggle notebook, you click on the **New Notebook** button in the dataset header. This will create a notebook in your Kaggle account that links to the dataset.
- Download the dataset: To download a copy of the dataset to your computer, click on the **Download** button in the dataset header at the top of the page.
- Open the file in Google Sheets: To open a Google Sheets view of the file, click on the **download** icon at the top-right of the Data Explorer. You can then download the file.
