# Live and static insights

Previously, you learned about data storytelling and interpreting your dataset through a narrative. In this reading, you will explore the difference between live and static insights to make your data even clearer.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/twIoYsxCQvWCKGLMQpL1ag_a4f93ceb32fe4e0b96e55610e2a5c7fc_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-4.46.25-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=BzcrmsXYR467EIS1f7S1X4ZCrX9XifmpUyXuYq4IlBc)

## Live versus static

Identifying whether data is live or static depends on certain factors:

- How old is the data?
- How long until the insights are stale or no longer valid to make decisions?
- Does this data or analysis need updating on a regular basis to remain valuable?

**Static data** involves providing screenshots or snapshots in presentations or building dashboards using snapshots of data. There are pros and cons to static data.

**PROS**

- Can tightly control a point-in-time narrative of the data and insight
- Allows for complex analysis to be explained in-depth to a larger audience

**CONS**

- Insight immediately begins to lose value and continues to do so the longer the data remains in a static state
- Snapshots can't keep up with the pace of data change

**Live data** means that you can build dashboards, reports, and views connected to automatically updated data.

**PROS**

- Dashboards can be built to be more dynamic and scalable
- Gives the most up-to-date data to the people who need it at the time when they need it
- Allows for up-to-date curated views into data with the ability to build a scalable “single source of truth” for various use cases
- Allows for immediate action to be taken on data that changes frequently
- Alleviates time/resources spent on processes for every analysis

**CONS**

- Can take engineering resources to keep pipelines live and scalable, which may be outside the scope of some companies' data resource allocation
- Without the ability to interpret data, you can lose control of the narrative, which can cause data chaos (i.e. teams coming to conflicting conclusions based on the same data)
- Can potentially cause a lack of trust if the data isn’t handled properly

## Key takeaways

Analysts need to familiarize themselves with the business and data so they can recommend when an updated static analysis is needed or should be refreshed. Also, this data insight will help you make the case for what sorts of analyses, visualizations, and additional data are recommended for the types of decisions that the business needs to make.

# Create your first Tableau dashboard

You're going to take what you've learned about data visualizations and create a dashboard.

Tableau contains tons of other functionality to build dashboards that update in real time and include interactive visualizations.

Dashboards are important in data analysis because they enable people to visualize data in dynamic and interactive ways, which can help enhance what you can do with your data presentations. Data visualizations are most useful when they are presented in a dashboard style format to stakeholders because dashboards put all the key information in the same place, making it easier to understand what's really important. Many dashboards also constantly update to reflect new data and can be interactive. No matter what style of dashboard you choose, they can help you present your data to stakeholders in an impactful way.

## Open Tableau

You'll need to navigate and sign-in to the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) online app. You may also refer back to the reading on how to create an account, a profile, loading, and linking datasets using the Tableau public app - [Using Tableau Public](https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data/supplement/bMjvq).

## Accessing the Dataset

Click on the link to create your own copy of the [CO2 Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1LwGHDgJkXSm8b0ziSDyC8pQGqjYVGpX9mAEVPs2KQgY/copy).

If you do not have a Google account, you may directly download the CO2 dataset by clicking below:

[CO2 DatasetXLSX File](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/EVkUZEQBRjS6Vbihr3z6aQ_eb9289d2c49e46d697fc919a582119f1_CO2-Dataset.xlsx?Expires=1717027200&Signature=Cb3viKIUU8c9sSss~QRNWQMcskJeeIYDOrjrh~OPTnKVas9Qo-FNwXyKf3IF~dHlp267ANVCAXzsg8IzlO-k3Hp118a153e1lyY60gvpdpfgyvgf70yDJ79C~oLIPApeyRbcQBC-2lOIhO0~vqaJb4-zvTAYfm5~uV9nUIoNTWw_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)

## Load the Dataset

1. Now that you have logged into Tableau Public, access the data source dashboard by clicking on the **Create tab**, then the **Web Authoring** option at the top of the landing page. Next, click on the center button, **Upload from computer**, and select the CO2 Dataset that has been downloaded to your device.
2. Once the dataset has been loaded, direct your attention to the bottom of the data source tabs in the bottom left corner of the window. This opens the data sources folder Tableau public has created on your machine by default. Going forward, you should save any datasets you're working with to the data sources folder. Keeping your data files in one place is a best practice that will keep you organized.
3. Make a note that all of the tabs within the dataset are arranged into a vertical toolbar on the left side of the page.
4. Drag the Sheet titled **CO2 Data Cleaned** from the left bar to the middle of the page and click on the button **Update Automatically** option after dragging the sheet icon.
5. Navigate back to the tab titled **Sheet 1** at the bottom of the page and click on it. At this point, a new window with a vertical dashboard titled **Tables** will appear.
6. Drag the *green* **# Year** icon to the **Columns** box located at the top of the page.
7. Drag the *green* **# CO2 (kt)** icon to the **Rows** box located at the top of the page.
8. Drag the *blue* **Abc Region** icon to the **Colors** icon containing the 4-colored dots.
9. You have now created your first basic timeline dashboard, which indicates the level of CO2 (kilotons) emitted by the various parts of the globe from 1960 to 2012.
10. You may also do a preliminary analysis of the number of categories, rows, data ranges, and any null values that appear in the data source page. This will give you a sense of more dashboard types and styles that can be generated from the dataset.

## Create Additional Dashboards

Directions on how to create additional dashboard types with Tableau are [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_create.htm).

Great, you've created your first basic dashboard!

3. Locate the **My Tableau Repository** folder on your computer. This is usually placed in the Documents folder of your local files. If you cannot find the folder, use the search bar in your computer’s file explorer.

4. Open the folder **My Tableau Repository**, then open the folder **Datasources**.

5. Drag your datasets for Tableau from where you downloaded them into the **Datasources** folder. This will help you keep track of your datasets for various projects and stay organized.

**Note:** As a best practice, you should always move your datasets for Tableau into the **Datasources** folder.

# **Step 4: Create a dashboard**

The example project contains the CO2 dataset which has  two separate visualizations. Select **Sheet 1**. This visualization shows the average CO2 per capita of each country. Now, select **Sheet 2**. This visualization is a line chart of the CO2 production of each global region over time.

You will use these visualizations to create a dashboard. Select the **Add Dashboard** button, which is the middle button on the bottom row with a symbol that appears like a spreadsheet with a plus sign.

This will open a new dashboard. Your screen should appear like this:

Menus across the top are File, Data, Worksheet, Dashboard, Story, Analysis, Map, Format, Server, Window, and Help. The Dashboard tab is selected on the left, showing size and a list of the sheets. Below this, an Objects menu lists Horizontal Container, Vertical Container, Test, Extension, Ask Data, Data Story, Image, Blank, Workflow, and  Web Page. Below this are options for tiled or floating, and a checkbox to select show dashboard tile.

## 

# **Step 5: Add visualizations**

To add visualizations, drag the appropriate sheets onto the dashboard in the layout that you prefer. In this case, you’ll add the map visualization from **Sheet 1** on top of the line graph from **Sheet 2**.

1. Start by finding **Sheet 1** in the Sheets section in the sidebar. Select and drag **Sheet 1** onto the area that says **Drop sheets here**. Sheet 1 should appear under the Sheets tab:

2. Select and drag **Sheet 2** onto the visualization. You’ll notice that the visualization adjusts to show the layout depending on where you drag the sheet. Place **Sheet 2** so that it takes up the bottom half.

# **Step 6: Clean the dashboard**

The dashboard currently contains three legends, but only two of them are needed. The legend of grayscale values represents the CO2 Per Capita by size.

CO2 per capita is represented by size and color. As such, Tableau creates two legends. To simplify the visualization, your best choice is to delete the topmost legend that corresponds to size.

The relationship between small and large emissions can be interpreted by the relative sizes of the circles. However, the color representing the number of emissions per capita is not interpretable without the legend.

1. Delete the topmost legend. To do this, select it and then select the close button (**X**) to remove it from the dashboard.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/y1Wm3hDtS6WvCEwBs2Cz8g_42ae90eb39ea4448a1581f94be817fe1_C6M3L2_image18_callout.jpg?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=xkFqnQEP0ZdalKIcj6Y9Zm1aNGvESj_AMc3AJBUY2K4)

Now that it’s been removed, you’ll set the remaining legends to float. This will allow you to drag the legends where you want to place them.

2. Select a legend.

3. Select the dropdown list for **More Options**. From there, select **Floating**.

This arrow opens a menu including Edit Colors, Format Legends, Title, Edit Title, Layout, Add Show/Hide Button, Floating, Fix Height, Edit Height, Select Container: Vertical Container, Deselect, Remove from Dashboard, Rename Dashboard Item. Floating is highlighted.

4. Drag the legend onto the top-right corner of the map visualization.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 and float the remaining legend onto the top-right corner of the bottom graph. When you’re finished, your dashboard should appear like this:

You’ve now created a basic dashboard. Tableau contains tons of other functionality that allows for dashboards that update automatically or interactive dashboards and visualizations.
