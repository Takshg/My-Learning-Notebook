**Key Points:**

- **R Markdown (RMD):** A file format that combines R code, text, and output into a single document. It is commonly used for creating reports and presentations.
- **YAML Header:** The top section of an RMD file that contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and output format.
- **Markdown:** A lightweight markup language used for formatting text in RMD files. It is easy to learn and use.
- **Headers:** Used to organize and structure the text in an RMD file. They are created using hashtags (#). The more hashtags, the smaller the header.
- **Links:** Created using angle brackets (< >). They allow you to link to external resources or other parts of your document.
- **Bold and Italic Text:** Created using asterisks (*). Two asterisks on either side of a word will bold it, while one asterisk on either side will italicize it.
- **In-line Code:** Code that is inserted directly into the text of an RMD file. It is displayed in a gray box.

**Definitions:**

- **Metadata:** Data about data. In the context of RMD files, it includes information about the document itself, such as the title, author, and date.
- **Markup Language:** A language used to add formatting to text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to learn and use.
- **Output Format:** The format in which the RMD file will be rendered. Common output formats include HTML, PDF, and Word.

**Additional Notes:**

- The video also covers how to knit an RMD file, which is the process of converting it into the desired output format.
- There are many other formatting options available in R Markdown, which are covered in more detail in other videos and resources.
