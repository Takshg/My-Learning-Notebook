# Bias: from questions to conclusions

## **What is Bias?**

- Bias is defined as a preference for or against a person, group, or thing, which can be conscious or subconscious.
- It is a natural human tendency to streamline thinking and make quick judgments.

### **Impact of Bias in Data:**

- Data bias is a type of error that skews results in a specific direction.
- It can occur due to various factors, such as biased survey questions, unrepresentative sample groups, and limitations in data collection methods.
- Bias in data can have serious consequences, leading to inaccurate conclusions and unfair outcomes.

### **Examples of Bias:**

- Clinical studies with more male participants than females, leading to undetected heart conditions in women.
- Underrepresentation of people with disabilities in health research.
- Biased data collection methods, such as time-pressured surveys, affecting data quality.

### **Importance of Recognizing Bias:**

- As a data analyst, it is crucial to be aware of bias throughout the data analysis process, from data collection to presentation of conclusions.
- Recognizing bias allows for mitigation strategies and ensures fair and accurate data-driven decisions.

### **Future Exploration:**

- The video concludes by highlighting the need to address bias in data and explore scenarios where it might be beneficial.

## **Key Points:**

- Bias is a natural human tendency that can influence data and lead to inaccurate conclusions.
- Recognizing and mitigating bias is essential for responsible data analysis.
- Bias can have significant real-world consequences, impacting various aspects of life.

## **Definitions:**

- **Bias:** A preference for or against a person, group, or thing, which can be conscious or subconscious.
- **Data Bias:** A type of error that systematically skews data results in a specific direction.

# Biased and unbiased data

## **Key Points:**

- **Bias:**
    - Occurs when data systematically skews results in a certain direction, making them unreliable.
    - Can be caused by our own preconceived or subconscious notions.
- **Sampling Bias:**
    - Occurs when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole.
    - Can be avoided by using random sampling techniques.
- **Identifying Sampling Bias:**
    - Compare the sample to the population using visualizations like bar charts.
    - Look for misalignments between the sample and the population.

### **Example:**

- Determining the class's preferred weather (warm or cold) by surveying only the first 10 female students is an example of sampling bias.
- This sample is not representative of the entire class because it excludes other genders.
- Using a randomized sample that includes all genders would provide an unbiased representation of the class.

## **Additional Points:**

- The video also mentions other types of bias that will be explored later.
- Visualizations can be a powerful tool for identifying bias in data.

## **Definitions:**

- **Bias:** A prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.
- **Sampling Bias:** A bias in which a sample is not representative of the population from which it is drawn.
- **Random Sampling:** A method of selecting a sample from a population in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

Overall, this video emphasizes the importance of recognizing and avoiding bias in data, particularly through proper sampling techniques

# Understand bias in data

## **Key Points:**

- **Data Bias:**
    - **Sampling Bias:** Occurs when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole.
    - **Observer Bias:** Tendency for different people to observe things differently.
    - **Interpretation Bias:** Tendency to interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way.
    - **Confirmation Bias:** Tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.
- **Importance of Avoiding Bias:** Biased data can lead to inaccurate and misleading results.
- **Data Inspection:** All data needs to be inspected for accuracy and trustworthiness.

## **Definitions:**

- **Data Bias:** Systematic errors that can occur in data collection, analysis, or interpretation.
- **Sampling Bias:** A type of data bias that occurs when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole.
- **Observer Bias:** A type of data bias that occurs when different people observe things differently.
- **Interpretation Bias:** A type of data bias that occurs when people interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way.
- **Confirmation Bias:** A type of data bias that occurs when people search for or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.
