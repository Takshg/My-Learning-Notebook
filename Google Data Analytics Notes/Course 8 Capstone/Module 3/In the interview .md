# The interview process

Think of your job interview process as having four stages: introduction, skills test, compatibility, and decision-making. In this reading, you’ll review the different stages to help you better prepare. Along the way, you’ll learn more about Interview Warmup, a tool designed specifically to help you practice your interview skills. This is a great way to gain confidence before your actual interviews.

## Interview stages

You will likely be required to go through multiple rounds of interviews. Each interview will vary in the types of questions asked and what is expected of you. Continue reading to learn about different types of interviews.

### Stage 1: Introduction (resume and portfolio)

The goal of the introductory interview is for the recruiter to get to know you. They want to find out who you are and assess your background. This is your chance to shine. Have your portfolio and resume ready and be prepared to speak concisely about your qualifications, experience, and skills using specific examples.

### Stage 2: The skill test interview (case study)

This is usually your second interview and it will often be conducted by a fellow data analyst or data engineer. In this interview, you will be given a technical assessment testing your SQL and programming skills. You will also be asked to complete a case study or a behavioral test. Your potential employer wants to know if you can do the job that you’re interviewing for, so they will be focused on getting you to demonstrate your skills. Make sure you’re prepared with well-formed answers that highlight your technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.

### Stage 3: The compatibility interview

In some cases, there will be an additional interview to determine mutual compatibility between you and the company. To give you a comprehensive idea of what the work culture is like, the interviewer might include other members of the team during this round.

Often the goal here is to determine if you are a good fit with the rest of the team that you will be working with. This might include your peers, as well as the person you might report to. As with the introductory interview, get ready to discuss yourself more in-depth, using examples from your portfolio and resume as needed.

### Stage 4: Decision-making

When your last interview concludes, it’s advisable to ask about next steps and a timeline of when a hiring decision will be made. Take note that the process can take anywhere from four-to six weeks as things are finalized.

You will likely receive one of three responses: an offer letter, a rejection letter, or no communication. Receiving a job offer is very exciting and something you can take pride in. However, don’t feel pressured or obligated to accept the first offer you receive. Feel free to ask for time to consider, do your research on a fair salary or benefits package, and be open-minded and willing to compromise.

## Build your network

Unfortunately, there are times when you will receive a rejection. Despite any disappointments you may have, responding back with a thoughtful email will create a professional relationship with that hiring manager or company. You may even stand out in a way that might benefit your career in the long run. Generally, this email should be a short thank you letter expressing your appreciation for the opportunity and for the time they spent interviewing you.

There will even be cases where you will receive no response from the hiring manager. This doesn’t necessarily mean you did not get the position and sending an inquiring follow-up email will help clear things up. However, if you indeed didn’t get the position, then simply accept it and continue applying for jobs. Remember, every rejection is an opportunity to practice your interviewing skills.

## Practice interview skills

Now that you’ve learned about the different interview stages, it’s time to practice interviewing. You can get useful interview experiences by answering questions you might encounter in an actual interview.

In this video, Sally provides specific examples of past challenges and how she used her problem-solving skills to overcome them.

**4. Salary negotiation**: Once the interviews are over, if the company offers you the position, you and the company both need to agree on your starting salary. Although it is often an uncomfortable part of the process for many job applicants, negotiating a salary that you feel is fair is very important. In this final video lesson of the series titled, [Scenario video: Negotiating terms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/lecture/MS5NP/scenario-video-negotiating-terms), the video highlights how Sally has done her research and didn’t feel pressured to accept the company’s first offer on the spot.

When it comes to job interviews, there is no such thing as being too prepared. Be sure to do your research on the company, the role you are applying to, and salary expectations for the position. Practice marketing yourself and your skills and use active listening whenever you are asking and answering questions.

# What makes a great pitch

There is a certain question that you will probably be asked throughout your career, especially during professional interviews: “Tell me about yourself?” This can be tricky to answer well, but the goal is to positively and accurately represent yourself using your past and present experiences and skills–essentially, you need to pitch yourself. In this reading, you will learn how to promote yourself as an effective and highly skilled data analyst in a job interview. Even if you don’t have any professional data analysis work on your resume yet, experience and skills you gained from previous work of any kind can be useful to share if you pitch it the right way.

To help you prepare, here are some possible questions you might be asked in an interview, including technical questions to assess specific practical knowledge and questions that require you to apply your own personal experiences.

## Technical questions

- *“What are your preferred tools for analysis?”* This is a chance to demonstrate that you are well-versed in data analysis, with proficiency in SQL, Excel, and R programming.
- *“How do you maintain integrity in your data?”* Reliability and accuracy are essential parts of good data analysis, and any issues with your data can have a major impact on data-driven business decisions. Be prepared to discuss the methods you use for error checking and validation.
- *“Do you understand different SQL functions and the roles they play?”* SQL is arguably one of the most important skills for you to have as a data analyst. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of different types of SQL functions and their value or result.

## Personal experience questions

- “*Was there a time when you took initiative during a project and what was the outcome?*” This question can come in many forms with slightly different wording, but the goal is to understand your leadership abilities and how you have used them in the past.
- “*What was the most challenging project you have ever been faced with*?” This question is usually meant to assess your problem-solving and interpersonal skills. Come to the interview prepared with several different examples of how you successfully navigated a difficult project or situation in the past.
- “*How would you explain a complex topic to a stakeholder who was unfamiliar with it*?” This question helps your interviewer get a sense of how skilled you are at communicating effectively in high-pressure or sensitive circumstances.
- “*How do you cope when things don’t go according to plan?*” It is important to be adaptable, especially when things don’t go the way you expected. This question provides a great opportunity for you to explain how you coped with unexpected changes and adapted quickly to a different course of action.

Try crafting answers to each of these questions and coming up with fitting examples for each scenario. Write the answers down and practice them until they feel natural and unrehearsed.

## Prepare yourself

There is no way for you to know exactly what your interviewer will ask you. But preparing some polished and professional answers to common interview questions can be incredibly helpful. Learning how to successfully pitch yourself and your skills as a data analyst takes practice. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will likely be during the actual interview, regardless of what questions you get asked.

# Top tips for interview success

You just learned about some best practices when it comes to data analyst interviews. Read on for four final preparation tips to help set you up for interviewing success.

## Tip 1: Find connections between the job listing and your resume

First, re-read your resume and the job description to help you draw lines between the two. Where do they connect? Then, as you interview, include specific keywords or phrases from the job description that match skills you possess or achievements you have accomplished previously in your career.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/v6c4mv98QgunOJr_fJILQA_4834933bb90d47c19e8a69ac43b4b5f5_Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-11.53.20-AM.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=3KVUuNvkvNzN__KTR_T3-duM5Yg-AdeTZlUFoa1fl28)

## Tip 2: Focus on data

As you start to think about things you want to highlight in your interview, don’t forget to include *data*. This helps your interviewer understand not just your overall achievements, but how big of an impact you made. What data can you provide that tells the story of your experience in terms of the needs of this position? The “equation” we suggest including goes something like this: *I accomplished X as measured by Y doing Z*. Here’s an example: “I increased customer satisfaction by 22% in three months by designing a new digital onboarding process.”

Accomplished X: Increased customer satisfaction

as by measured Y: by 22% in three months

by doing Z: by designing a new digital onboarding process

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hBf4nnrZSGiX-J562ZhofQ_a18e686b93f241bfb4095e9816fd235c_Screen-Shot-2021-03-14-at-6.30.56-PM.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=vd0w9pKw4YGZaj6XyfXMKJ6mD-lngmR5xZ3yNf43F3Q)

If you don’t have access to this kind of data from a previous position, you can still indicate the scope you were accountable for and strengthen the language you use when describing your responsibilities by including action words like *provided*, *created*, *developed*, *supported*, *implemented*, and *generated.* For example: “I implemented a new scheduling system that led to 95% of the team meeting deadlines.”

## Tip 3: Look back at past work experiences

Review your work history. That may not sound like something you need to prepare for, but most of us have done more than we think and it’s easy to forget some of our own wins (and lessons learned from mistakes).

Think of examples of times you achieved something so you are prepared to answer questions  like “Tell me about a time when . . .” or “How would you approach this situation . . .?"

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/TVZrUBs_ScOWa1AbP9nDsw_130b5020dbab44d2b5d43f1b4a6e3265_unnamed-15-.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=Nu365XoKXegBd0xKMjnanWSDyMY3p-YZkxkz9SThhxU)

## Tip 4: Come ready with questions

Next, come to the interview with your own questions, such as “What are some upcoming projects I’d be working on? What current goals is the company focused on? Can you tell me about the team I’ll be working with?” This not only shows you care about understanding the company and the position you’re applying for, but it’s also a testament to the research you’ve done by looking into the company. Besides, this is your opportunity to interview them as well.

This type of preparation will help you feel confident and prepared to talk about yourself and the position. It will enable you to fully explore your experience, the position, and your career aspirations and really connect with the employer!
