# Your portfolio and case study checklist

It is important to understand the key components of both a portfolio and case study, as both are essential to success when applying for jobs. The following are checklists to help cover your bases. If you'd like to refer to this checklist in the future, you can download the PDF below:

[Your-portfolio-and-case-study-checklist.pdf](../NQfW0r6WQsmH1tK-luLJeg_cf9d5450675649f1a49897eda567916d_Your-portfolio-and-case-study-checklist.pdf)

## What to include in your portfolio

Even if you don’t have previous data analytics work experience, you can still craft a great portfolio that represents your new skills and offers insight into who you are. Be sure to include the following in your portfolio:

- **Biography**: The main focus of your portfolio is to introduce yourself in a strong and memorable way. Write a concise and clear introduction of yourself. The goal is to capture your audience’s interest and compel them to want to meet you to learn more.
- **Contact page**: Be sure to include a way for others to get in touch with you, whether it be via email, phone call (if you are comfortable), or social media handles (especially LinkedIn). You might find that your website has its own built-in contact form if you use common website builders.
- **Resume**: In previous readings, [Add technical skills to your resume](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data/supplement/8FBgn/add-technical-skills-to-your-resume) and [Add professional skills to your resume](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data/supplement/U8xZj/add-professional-skills-to-your-resume), you learned how to craft a resume that reflects your skills and your experience. Be sure to include a resume somewhere in your portfolio.
- **Accomplishments**: You are not just limited to your past experiences. Any present career-worthy highlights you can think of should be included. This can be any certifications you have earned, data analytics events you have attended, or even blog posts you have published.
- **An image of you (optional)**: Add a personal touch with your photo. All you need is a simple, clear photo that represents you well.

## What to include in a case study

During your interview process, you will very likely encounter the case study interview. In this interview, you will be provided with a business-related scenario where you analyze a problem and come up with the best solution. You will have a certain amount of time to solve this so it is best to be prepared for any scenario you are given. A great case study will include the following:

- **Introduction**: Make sure to state the purpose of the case study. This includes what the scenario is and an explanation on how it relates to a real-world obstacle. Feel free to note any assumptions or theories you might have depending on the information provided.
- **Problems**: You need to identify what the major problems are, explain how you have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support your findings.
- **Solutions**: Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Don’t forget to include pros and cons for each solution.
- **Conclusion**: End your presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this.
- **Next steps**: Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will affect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when.

## Mapping certificate skills to job requirements

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/fPIAwZCvRxSyAMGQr6cU0g_c2134fd6adee4bb78103cc34938aa906_Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.16.21-AM.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=D0nMhPpr9YGckjMAYq0kdHn8MwH3ftWX6H5EOttxiLs)

The skills you gain with the Google Data Analytics Certificate align with skills that data analyst jobs require. When you create your resume, the way you present your skills can capture the attention of a recruiter or a hiring manager. Many career counselors recommend that you customize your resume each time you apply for a job so that your experience and skills align as closely as possible with the requirements listed in the job description.

For each of the relevant skills in the previous table, consider the following:

- Possible phrases from job descriptions
- Examples of matching skills from this certificate

Let’s go through the skills for data analysts and examine common phrases you might find in job descriptions.

## Selecting and developing a case study

In this course, you have options for selecting and developing a case study. You can choose one of two possible tracks.

The first track has two cases already defined. You can pick one of these cases and follow through on the data analysis to answer the questions presented to address business problems. For more information, refer to the [track A details](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/bY66y/track-1-details).

The second track allows you to design your own case study about a topic that you are interested in. You can practice all but the Act phase of the Data Analysis Process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. For more information, refer to the [track B details](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/zbwbs/track-2-details). You can also return to [The phases of data analysis and this program](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/JjA1f/the-phases-of-data-analysis-and-this-program) video to review the steps of the Data Analysis Process.

After familiarizing yourself with the details of each track, refer to the information in [Choose your case study track](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/NTV8r/choose-your-case-study-track) and decide which track you want to follow.

## Creating your online portfolio

After completing your case study, you will create an online portfolio to store and display it. Refer to [Create your online portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/m86c7/create-your-online-portfolio). It provides an overview of platforms that can potentially host your portfolio and case study.

## Updating your LinkedIn profile

In an earlier course, you learned about creating an online presence with a LinkedIn account in [Getting started with LinkedIn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/supplement/3QDa4/get-started-with-linkedin). Access your LinkedIn profile again to add a link to your online portfolio in your profile.

## Practicing your case study pitch

You can start to prepare for interviews by creating an elevator pitch for your case study. Refer to [What makes a great pitch](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/y5U2D/what-makes-a-great-pitch) to understand the kinds of questions to prepare for. Try to include aspects of your elevator pitch in your answers to the sample questions provided in the reading. Then, practice pitching your case study as part of your planned responses to commonly asked interview questions.
