# Introduction to building your portfolio

In this part of the course, you will prepare a case study that you can include in your online portfolio. All of the resources provided will help you to succeed in this goal (referred to as the Google Data Analytics Capstone).

There is an old saying that you learn by doing. You have already learned about the importance of each phase in the data analysis process when working with a dataset. You will soon learn about the importance of having an online portfolio. The Google Data Analytics Capstone will enable you to actually put the two together—a dataset you took through the data analysis process for your portfolio.

By completing your capstone project, you will practice:

- Going through the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Share phases of the data analysis process
- Stating a business task clearly
- Importing data from a real dataset
- Documenting any data cleaning that you perform on the dataset
- Analyzing the data
- Creating data visualizations from your analysis
- Summarizing key findings from your analysis
- Documenting your conclusions and recommendations
- Creating and publishing your case study

Your case study will demonstrate these fundamental skills to prospective employers and showcase what you have learned from the Google Data Analytics Certificate. It will represent your knowledge and capabilities in your portfolio.

# Get started with your case study

**Key Points:**

- You will be creating your own case study project.
- There are two tracks you can choose from:
    - **Track 1:** Choose a business question similar to what interviewers might ask. You will be provided with specific business tasks and datasets.
    - **Track 2:** Find a public dataset to explore something you're personally interested in. This could be anything from analyzing a video game to studying a wildlife population.
- You will use the case study outline to help you start your project. The outline follows the phases of the data analysis lifecycle.
- You will complete each phase from asking the right questions to preparing, processing, and analyzing your data, until you finally build your presentation and share it in your portfolio.
- Each phase will have key questions and activities to help guide you through the process.
- You can always go back to any part of the program to review something.
- The data you will be working with is public and open-source.
- It is essential to avoid plagiarism by citing your sources.
- Public, open-source data can be easily searched, and we don't want to pass it off as our own work.
- Plagiarism can have serious negative consequences, legally and personally.
- The beauty of our work as data analysts is that we can share and collaborate with each other.
- Let's remember to give credit to our sources.

**Definitions:**

- **Case study:** A detailed examination of a particular person, group, or situation.
- **Portfolio:** A collection of work samples that showcases your skills and experience.
- **Data analysis lifecycle:** The process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data.

# Choose your case study track

A **case study** is a common way for employers to assess your skills and observe how you would approach a data-related project. For example, you might be asked to clean and analyze a dataset, create a proposal around how to measure the success of a project, or figure out and define success metrics for a given project.

In this course, you will practice working with a case study. You can fulfill the case study requirement through one of two tracks.

| **Track A: working with existing questions and datasets** | **Track B: choosing your own questions and dataset** |
| --- | --- |
| Demonstrate job skills for future interviews using a given dataset for analysis. | Create a more flexible portfolio piece about a personal interest that you have. |

## [Track A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/bY66y/track-1-details)

If you select Track A, you can choose from these two options to complete your case study requirement:

- **Case study: Cyclistic bike-share analysis**

This is an opportunity to analyze historical bicycle trip data in order to identify trends. Understanding how casual riders behave differently from riders with paid memberships is important. This analysis will help executives to make decisions about marketing programs and strategies to convert casual riders to riders with annual memberships. Refer to [Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/7PGIT/case-study-1-how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success) for more details about this case study

- **Case study: Bellabeat product analysis**

This is an opportunity to analyze publicly available fitness tracker data in order to gain insights into how consumers are using these products. Identifying any trends in this data will be key. This will help Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, determine marketing strategy in the future. Refer to [Case Study 2: How can a wellness company play it smart?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/ZsmDD/case-study-2-how-do-media-companies-find-the-next-binge-worthy-show) for more details about this case study.

## [Track B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/zbwbs/track-2-details)

If you select Track B, you must search for a public dataset that focuses on an area of interest to you. Are you interested in housing the homeless? Are you interested in conserving open spaces for public use? Are you interested in figuring out if Bitcoin is a good investment? Track B gives you freedom to investigate anything that you like, but it does assume that you will be self-directed to develop your own case study from scratch. You will need to come up with all the requirements for the analysis.
