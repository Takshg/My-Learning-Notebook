# Create your online portfolio

This reading provides a checklist about what to include in your portfolio, where you can set up accounts to host your portfolio, and how to add content to your portfolio.

## What to include

You learned that a portfolio represents your skills and showcases some of your previous projects to potential employers. Keep your portfolio:

- **Personal:** Show who you are, what you are interested in, and what is important to you.
- **Simple:** Display your work with easy navigation and without cluttered pages.
- **Relevant:** Match your work to the skills included in job descriptions.
- **Presentable:** Emphasize quality in the samples you show.
- **Unique:** Showcase your own work; cite sources of content to avoid plagiarism.

## Where to set up accounts

Choose a platform to host your portfolio. Medium, Google Sites, and Wordpress are good for blogging. GitHub and Kaggle are better for code. And finally, as you know, Tableau is great for visualizations. Next, create an account on the platform that you chose. Check out these steps to set up accounts on various platforms:

- [Set up an account on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
- [Set up an account on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/122858)
- [Set up an account on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) – *Click the orange "Sign Up" button*
- [Set up an account on Medium](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004915268-Sign-in-or-sign-up-to-Medium)
- [Set up an account on WordPress](https://wordpress.com/start/user)
- [Set up a site on Google Sites](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/6372878?hl=en&ref_topic=7184580)

## How to add content to your portfolio

Finally, refer to the following table for some links to articles that can help you to manage your portfolio. Articles are free but some sites limit the number of articles you can view per month. In that case, bookmark the article to view it later.

| **Platform** | **Information to help you manage your portfolio** |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub | [8 steps to publishing your portfolio on GitHub](https://medium.com/tunapanda-institute/8-steps-to-publish-your-portfolio-on-github-9d6e6e3d2e84): Follow the steps in this article to create a repository for your portfolio. |
| Kaggle | [Publishing your first dataset on Kaggle](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/publishing-your-first-dataset-on-kaggle-6be8c37e59e8): Follow the steps in this article to publish your own dataset and make it public. |
| Tableau | Any visualization created in Tableau Public is already public by default. A lot more is involved to add a Tableau visualization to another hosted site. For that reason, it is probably best to link to Tableau visualizations when your portfolio is hosted on a personal website or on a different platform, like GitHub. |
| Medium | [Getting started with a Medium publication](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004681607-Getting-started-with-a-Medium-publication): Follow the process in this guide to create your own publication. |
| WordPress | [Get Published](https://wordpress.com/learn/get-published/): Follow these instructions to create pages or post content on your site. |
| Google Sites | [Publish & share your site](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/6372880): Follow these instructions to publish your site and share it publicly.
[Use a custom domain for your site](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/9068867): Refer to these instructions if you want to use a custom URL for your portfolio. |

# Hands On Activity: Add your portfolio to Kaggle

## Activity Overview

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/UWFf-U9hTzKhX_lPYX8yBw_8c2e9cd211e3479a89816c7b1816ab07_image4.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=K4Xgw1kXlNgZ2edFaCJJzwst-MOgR_tArwUv-M0tRTQ)

Earlier in this course, you learned about what to put in an effective data analyst portfolio. In this activity, you will add your portfolio content to a Kaggle notebook.

As you create your data analytics portfolio, you might find yourself using Kaggle or another online platform to host it. Kaggle hosts interactive notebooks that let you showcase your programming and hard work. If you have an existing portfolio, you can copy your content into Kaggle to have an additional way to share it.

By the time you complete this activity, you will have created a Kaggle notebook containing your portfolio content. Then you can easily share your work with a Kaggle link, enabling you to send your portfolio to more people.

# **Step-By-Step Instructions**

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item.

# **Step 1: Review types of Kaggle Notebooks**

First, it’s helpful to know the different kinds of Notebooks on Kaggle. Every kind of Kaggle Notebook uses code, but each one contains different languages for programming or writing text. The different types include:

- Scripts: Typically, these are code-only documents. Cells can be formatted in R or Python, and they execute each cell as code sequentially.
- RMarkdown scripts: Cells can be formatted in R and RMarkdown. These files are preferred by many R authors.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Cells can be formatted in Markdown, R, or Python. These are the most flexible.

Before you create a Notebook in Kaggle, decide which kind of Notebook you intend to use.

To share the code you wrote in this course, choose a Kaggle Notebook that supports R and Markdown, such as an R Markdown script or a Jupyter Notebook.

# **Step 2: Add R to your Notebook**

1. To begin, log in to Kaggle and go to [Kaggle.com/code](https://www.kaggle.com/code).

2. Select **+ Create** and select **< > New Notebook** to create a new notebook. If you want to use an existing notebook, go to the **Your work** tab and scroll to the notebook you want to use.

3. Decide whether to use a type of script or a Jupyter notebook based on your project’s needs. The editor will begin as a notebook by default. If you want to change your notebook to a script, click on **File** at the top of your editor and hover over **Editor Type**. This opens a drop-down menu to select **Notebook** or **Script**. For this activity, select **Notebook**.

4. Because the work you did in the last course was in R instead of Python, you need to change the notebook’s language. Select **File** at the top of your editor and hover over **Language**. This opens a dropdown menu with both options available. Select **R** if it isn’t selected already.

5. Open the file of a project you want to use in your portfolio. This can be the capstone project you completed during this course, an earlier activity you completed in a past course, or a personal project you created. Ideally, this project should demonstrate your coding ability and your data analytics knowledge.

6. Add the content of your portfolio piece. Copy the code you wrote into R cells and copy regular text or images into Markdown cells. To add a cell to the document, select **+ Code** or **+ Markdown**. It helps to test your code in the Kaggle interface by running it periodically as you write or copy it in. This way, you ensure that it doesn’t return an error.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 to upload your portfolio pieces to their own Kaggle notebooks.

You have now created (or duplicated) your portfolio in Kaggle! Your next step is to publish your portfolio.

# **Step 3: Publish your portfolio**

Now it’s time to publicly publish your portfolio on Kaggle. This will allow peers, hiring managers, and potential employers to view your skill set and provide feedback.

- **Note:** When you publish your portfolio, you will also need to publicize all documents associated with it. For example, if you include a link to a document on Google Drive, you will need to ensure it is also publicly viewable.

1. To begin, navigate to the **Your work** tab on the **Code** screen to bring you to the list of your notebooks and scripts.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mXt4FUxaSxqeDOX8PF1adQ_40b39d3d3c234f53944aefa227b59df1__iu0BIiZQ-yQQLj_qxIBCg_3205314ca7e54c04b1c5cf9f830220e1_Kagglepublishportfoliostep1_GDA_C8M2L4A01_Needs-emphasis.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=QP-y6gjN5mV1ofhV-XYMvXfPvIcp8SReuXttjyjrAu8)

2. Select the first notebook or script you’d like to publicize. At the top right-hand corner, click the **Share** button.

3. If the Share window indicates that the document is private, click the button next to the **Public** option.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qV2CbrYERPis3mAzjrt90w_c4964f88115a4a4888e016c73d895af1_oQnU3orGRUmKZ49gSrAe0A_80152da6fbf84b14b288304d79c4e3e1_Kagglepublishportfoliostep3_GDA_C8M2L4A01.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=BHHmGesFSRo26LcCBpZ8b_jxHrJ3embXF562yI5Bc34)

Once your project is public, you’ll be able to add relevant tags or any collaborators who contributed to the document. You can use tags to describe the topics your work relates to. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/tags) to learn more about which tags you can use on Kaggle.

4. Repeat these steps until you’ve made each piece in your portfolio public on Kaggle.

You have now uploaded your portfolio to Kaggle and can share your accomplishments with colleagues, hiring managers, and potential employers. You can update your portfolio as your skills as a data analyst continue to grow.

Now, share your portfolio by going to the **Your work** tab on Kaggle, selecting the project you’d like to share, and copying the URL from the address bar. Share this link to show the world your hard work!
