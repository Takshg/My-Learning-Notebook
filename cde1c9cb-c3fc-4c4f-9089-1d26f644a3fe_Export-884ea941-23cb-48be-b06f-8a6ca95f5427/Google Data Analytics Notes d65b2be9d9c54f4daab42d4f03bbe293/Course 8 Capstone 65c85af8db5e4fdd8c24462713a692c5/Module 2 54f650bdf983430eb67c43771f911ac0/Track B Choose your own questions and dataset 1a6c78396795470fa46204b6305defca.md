# Track B details

## Choose your own adventure

The second track involves finding a public dataset that focuses on something that interests you. You could choose any topic about which you want to analyze data—public bike use in your neighborhood, local wildlife migration, video game console sales, or anything else you are passionate about. You can follow the steps in the case study packet to guide you through this process. The case study packet provides public dataset recommendations, example business tasks, and steps to complete your analysis. This track is the most flexible, but that flexibility means that this track can be more challenging. You will have to use everything that you have learned so far to help you to complete this case study.

If this track interests you, explore the case study packet to learn more details, find the public dataset that you want to use, and complete your analysis. Then, you will be ready to upload and share your completed case study.

Inspiration is everywhere. You can get ideas for a case study to include in your portfolio from your hobbies, travels, children, volunteer work, and even something as common as waiting in line! For example, you might create a case study examining the effect of customer wait times on a company’s sales.

Let’s imagine you enjoy fishing. You can create a case study for your portfolio that relates to your hobby. It is helpful to browse Medium, GitHub, Tableau, and Kaggle to get an idea of what other people have already created and find some inspiration.

The *R Markdown - Fishing by Countries* notebook in Kaggle might be promising. You discover from this notebook that there is a public domain dataset called *Annual Nominal Fish Catches: Explore the impact of overfishing in the Northeast Atlantic region.*

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/09zstrz6QAac7La8-nAGfg_b62a63fd496e47d783937d9f64ff26cf_unnamed.png?expiry=1717200000000&hmac=7LtMkSknaOihtH4q7lQMPOFuQCx46jI2np0n2UsVt6k)

You might have just found a great dataset to use to create your own case study. You wouldn’t want to repeat the same analysis related to overfishing, but the data could reveal another pattern worth analyzing.

## Key takeaway

You can use the same procedure completed for the fishing example to search for case studies and data about any other topic that interests you. By including case studies that are personally meaningful to you in your portfolio, you give prospective employers a better sense of the kind of person you are and what inspires your work.
