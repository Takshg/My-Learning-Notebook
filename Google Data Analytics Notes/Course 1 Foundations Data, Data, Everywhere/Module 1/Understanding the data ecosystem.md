# Data Analysis Process Hierarchy

- The data analysis process isn’t a single defined structure or single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analyst. But there are some shared fundamentals.

### Examples of some architectures used by companies

### EMC’s Data Analysis Process

- EMC Corporation’s data analytics process is cyclic with six steps
    1. Discovery 
    2. Pre-processing data
    3. Model planning 
    4. Model building 
    5. Communicate results
    6. Operationalize 
- EMC Corporation is now Dell EMC. This model reflects the cyclical nature of typical business. These phases aren’t static milestones, each step connects and leads to the next and eventually repeats.

### SAS’s iterative process

- An iterative data analysis process was created by a company called SAS. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results
- The process is as follows:
    1. Ask 
    2. Prepare
    3. Explore
    4. Model 
    5. Implement
    6. Act
    7. Evaluate 
- The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Its process has seven steps, many of which mirror the other models, like ask, prepare, model, and act. But this process is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again.

### Project-based data analytics

- A project-based data analytics has five simple steps:
    1. Identifying the problem 
    2. Designing data requirements 
    3. Pre-processing data
    4. Performing data analysis 
    5. Visualizing data
- It doesn’t include the sixth phase, or the act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

### Big Data analytics process

- This process suggests phases divided into nine steps:
    1. Business case evaluation 
    2. Data identification 
    3. Data acquisition and filtering 
    4. Data extraction 
    5. Data validation and cleaning 
    6. Data aggregation and representation 
    7. Data analysis 
    8. Data visualization 
    9. Utilization of analysis results 
- This process appears to have three or four more steps than the previous models. But in reality, they have just broken down what has been referred to as prepare and process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase

# What is the data ecosystem?

- An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another.
- Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with another to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people that use them
- Data can also be found in something called the cloud. The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive. So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet. So the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location.
- The cloud plays a big part in the data ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions.
- For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews. As a data analyst, you could use this information to predict what these customers will buy in the future, and make sure the store has the products and stock when they're needed.
- Difference between data analytics and data analysis:
    - Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
    - Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data. It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.
- So when you think about data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, it's important to understand that all of these things fit under the data analytics umbrella

# How data informs better decisions

> Data-driven decision making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy.
> 

- Organizations in many different industries are empowered to make better, data driven decisions by data analysts all the time.
- The first step in data driven decision-making is figuring out the business need. Usually, this is a problem that needs to be solved.
- For example, a problem could be a new company needing to establish better brand recognition, so it can compete with bigger, more well-known competitors. Or maybe an organization wants to improve a product and needs to figure out how to source parts from a more sustainable or ethically responsible supplier. Or, it could be a business trying to solve the problem of unhappy employees, low levels of engagement, satisfaction and retention.
- Whatever the problem is, once it is defined, a data analyst finds data, analyzes it and uses it to uncover trends, patterns and relationships.
- Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what’s worked in the past. Other times, it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction.
- To get the most out of data-driven decision making, it is important to include the insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.

# Data and Gut Instinct

> **Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation.
> 

- Why gut instinct on its own can be a problem:
    - Data is at the heart of data-driven decision making so it is essential that data analysts focus on the data to ensure they make informed decisions.
    - If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be biased on your own experience making them biased. But even worse, decision based on gut instinct without any data to back them upm can cause mistakes.
    - Consider an example of a restaurant entrepreneur, partnering with a well-known chef to develop a new restaurant in a bustling part of the city’s central shopping district. The chef has several restaurants across the city. Banking on their reputation, the restaurant entrepreneur and chef followed gut instinct and created another uniquely themed restaurant. However, fundraising efforts fell short to fund the opening of the restaurant after months of planning and preparation. The property will go back on the market to be sold at a loss. Had the entrepreneur done more research, they would've found data showing prospective customers in this new restaurant location were very different from the chef's other restaurants.
- The more you understand the data related to a project, the easier it will be to figure out what is required. These efforts will also help you identify gaps and errors in your data so you can communicate your findings more effectively.

- How do we use gut instinct to our advantage?

    - Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. **The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project**. A lot of the times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis.
    - The way to figure out the perfect balance is to ask yourself these questions about the project:
        - How do I define success for this project?
        - What kind of results are needed?
        - Who will be informed?
        - Am I answering the question being asked?
        - How quickly does a decision need to be made?
    - For example, if you are working on a rush project, you might need to rely on your own knowledge and experience more than usual. There just isn’t enough time to thoroughly analyze all of the available data.
    - But if you get a project that involves plenty of time and resources, the best strategy is to be more data driven.
