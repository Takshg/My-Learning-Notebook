# Data collection in our world

### **Key Points:**

- **Data is everywhere:** From online activities like emails and social media posts to scientific observations and business surveys, data is constantly being generated.
- **Data generation and collection are crucial:** This process allows us to understand the world around us, make informed decisions, and improve various aspects of our lives.
- **Ethical considerations are important:** Data collection should be done responsibly, respecting people's privacy and rights.

### **Definitions:**

- **Data:** Any piece of information, including text, numbers, images, and videos.
- **Data generation:** The process of creating new data, often through human activity or automated systems.
- **Data collection:** The process of gathering existing data from various sources.

### **Real-world examples:**

- **U.S. Census Bureau:** Collects data about the population through forms, which is used for funding allocation and understanding demographics.
- **Healthcare industry:** Uses surveys to gather patient feedback and improve the quality of care.
- **Job interviews:** Both the interviewer and the candidate collect data to make informed decisions.
- **Scientific research:** Scientists collect data through observations and experiments to understand natural phenomena.

### **Methods of data collection:**

- **Forms, questionnaires, and surveys:** Commonly used to gather data from individuals.
- **Cookies:** Small files stored on computers that track online activity and preferences.
- **Observations:** Used in scientific research and other fields to gather data about the world around us.

### **Benefits of understanding data generation and collection:**

- **Provides context for data analysis:** Knowing how data is generated and collected helps us interpret it more effectively.
- **Improves data analysis efficiency:** Understanding data collection methods can streamline the analysis process.

### **Next steps:**

The video concludes by introducing the concept of data selection, which will be covered in the next section.

### **Additional notes:**

- The video emphasizes the importance of ethical data collection and respecting privacy.
- It provides examples from various industries to illustrate the diverse applications of data generation and collection.
- The video encourages learners to think critically about how data is generated and collected and how it can be used to improve various aspects of our lives.

# Determine what data to collect

### **Key Points:**

- **Data Dilemma:** With a vast amount of data available, choosing the right data for your project can be challenging.
- **Head Start:** Often, the data you need will be provided or your business task will guide your choices.
- **Data Collection Considerations:**
    - **Data Type:** Choosing the appropriate data type for your analysis, such as dates for traffic data.
    - **Data Source:** Determining the source of your data, whether it's first-party (collected by you), second-party (collected by another group and sold to you), or third-party (collected from external sources).
    - **Data Sample:** Selecting a representative sample of the population for analysis, rather than the entire population.
    - **Data Time Frame:** Deciding whether to use historical data or collect data over a specific period.
- **Data Approval:** Ensuring the data you choose is approved for use.
- **Data Accuracy and Trustworthiness:** Checking all data for accuracy, bias, and credibility, regardless of its source.

### **Definitions:**

- **Population:** All possible data values in a specific data set.
- **Sample:** A representative part of a population used for analysis.
- **First-party data:** Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources.
- **Second-party data:** Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold.
- **Third-party data:** Data collected from external sources who did not collect it directly.

### **Real-life Example:**

In the context of analyzing traffic patterns in a city, you might collect data on the number of cars on specific streets during rush hour. This data could be first-party (collected by you through observations) or second-party (purchased from an organization that conducts traffic studies). You would need to determine the appropriate sample size and time frame for data collection, and ensure the data is accurate and approved for use.

### **Additional Notes:**

- The video emphasizes the importance of choosing data that helps you find answers and solve problems, rather than getting distracted by irrelevant information.
- The video also mentions that more details about data collection will be covered in later lessons.

# Select the right data

- Following are some data-collection considerations to keep in mind for your analysis:

## How the data will be collected

- Decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive (and possibly purchase it) from another party. Data that you collect yourself is called first-party data.

## Data sources

- If you don’t collect the data using your own resources, you might get data from second-party or third-party data providers. **Second-party data** is collected directly by another group and then sold. **Third-party data** is sold by a provider that didn’t collect the data themselves. Third-party data might come from a number of different sources.

## Solving your business problem

- Datasets can show a lot of interesting information. But be sure to choose data that can actually help solve your problem question. For example, if you are analyzing trends over time, make sure you use time series data — in other words, data that includes dates.

## How much data to collect

- If you are collecting your own data, make reasonable decisions about sample size. A random sample from existing data might be fine for some projects. Other projects might need more strategic data collection to focus on certain criteria. Each project has its own needs.

## Time frame

- If you are collecting your own data, decide how long you will need to collect it, especially if you are tracking trends over a long period of time. If you need an immediate answer, you might not have time to collect new data. In this case, you would need to use historical data that already exists.
- Use the flowchart below if data collection relies heavily on how much time you have:
