# Hands On Activity: Create a scope of work

You have been learning about the role of a data analyst and how to manage, analyze, and visualize data. Now, you will consider a valuable tool to help you practice structured thinking and avoid mistakes: a scope-of-work (SOW).

In this activity, you’ll get practical experience developing an SOW document with the help of a handy template. You will then complete an example SOW for an imaginary project of your choosing and learn how analysts outline the work they are going to perform. By the time you complete this activity, you will be familiar with an essential, industry-standard tool, and gain comfort asking the right questions to develop an SOW.

Before you get started, take a minute to think about the main ideas, goals, and target audiences of SOW documents.

# **Step-by Step Instructions**

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item.

## **Step 1: Understand what you need to know about an SOW**

As a data analyst, it’s hard to overstate the importance of an SOW document. A well-defined SOW keeps you, your team, and everyone involved with a project on the same page. It ensures that all contributors, sponsors, and stakeholders share the same understanding of the relevant details.

### Why do you need an SOW?

The point of data analysis projects is to complete business tasks that are useful to the stakeholders. Creating an SOW helps to make sure that everyone involved, from analysts and engineers to managers and stakeholders, shares the understanding of what those business goals are, and the plan for accomplishing them.

Clarifying requirements and setting expectations are two of the most important parts of a project. Recall the first phase of the Data Analysis Process—**asking questions**.

As you ask more and more questions to clarify requirements, goals, data sources, stakeholders, and any other relevant info, an SOW helps you formalize it all by recording all the answers and details. In this context, the word “ask” means two things. Preparing to write an SOW is about asking questions to learn the necessary information about the project, but it’s also about clarifying and defining what you’re being asked to accomplish, and what the limits or boundaries of the “ask” are. After all, if you can’t make a distinction between the business questions you are and aren’t responsible for answering, then it’s hard to know what success means!

### What is a good SOW?

There’s no standard format for an SOW. They may differ significantly from one organization to another, or from project to project. However, they all have a few foundational pieces of content in common.

- **Deliverables**: What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project? When the project is complete, what are you expected to deliver to the stakeholders? Be specific here. Will you collect data for this project? How much, or for how long?

Avoid vague statements. For example, “fixing traffic problems” doesn’t specify the scope. This could mean anything from filling in a few potholes to building a new overpass. Be specific! Use numbers and aim for hard, measurable goals and objectives. For example: “Identify top 10 issues with traffic patterns within the city limits, and identify the top 3 solutions that are most cost-effective for reducing traffic congestion.”

- **Milestones**: This is closely related to your timeline. What are the major milestones for progress in your project? How do you know when a given part of the project is considered complete?

Milestones can be identified by you, by stakeholders, or by other team members such as the Project Manager. Smaller examples might include incremental steps in a larger project like “Collect and process 50% of required data (100 survey responses)”, but may also be larger examples like ”complete initial data analysis report” or “deliver completed dashboard visualizations and analysis reports to stakeholders”.

- **Timeline**: Your timeline will be closely tied to the milestones you create for your project. The timeline is a way of mapping expectations for how long each step of the process should take. The timeline should be specific enough to help all involved decide if a project is on schedule. When will the deliverables be completed? How long do you expect the project will take to complete? If all goes as planned, how long do you expect each component of the project will take? When can we expect to reach each milestone?
- **Reports**: Good SOWs also set boundaries for how and when you’ll give status updates to stakeholders. How will you communicate progress with stakeholders and sponsors, and how often? Will progress be reported weekly? Monthly? When milestones are completed? What information will status reports contain?

At a minimum, any SOW should answer all the relevant questions in the above areas. Note that these areas may differ depending on the project. But at their core, the SOW document should always serve the same purpose by containing information that is specific, relevant, and accurate. If something changes in the project, your SOW should reflect those changes.

### What is in and out of scope?

SOWs should also contain information specific to what is and isn’t considered part of the project. The scope of your project is everything that you are expected to complete or accomplish, defined to a level of detail that doesn’t leave any ambiguity or confusion about whether a given task or item is part of the project or not.

Notice how the previous example about studying traffic congestion defined its scope as the area within the city limits. This doesn’t leave any room for confusion — stakeholders need only to refer to a map to tell if a stretch of road or intersection is part of the project or not.  Defining requirements can be trickier than it sounds, so it’s important to be as specific as possible in these documents, and to use quantitative statements whenever possible.

For example, assume that you’re assigned to a project that involves studying the environmental effects of climate change on the coastline of a city: How do you define what parts of the coastline you are responsible for studying, and which parts you are not?

In this case, it would be important to define the area you’re expected to study using GPS locations, or landmarks. Using specific, quantifiable statements will help ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of what’s expected.

# Staying objectives

This video emphasizes the importance of **contextualizing data** and recognizing **data bias** for making data-driven decisions.

**Key Points:**

- **Data needs context:** Numbers alone don't tell the whole story. Understanding the context in which data was collected and analyzed is crucial for accurate interpretation.
- **Context is subjective:** Different people may interpret the same data differently based on their own biases and experiences.
- **Data bias exists:** Data can be biased due to various factors like collection methods, cultural norms, and personal agendas.
- **Objectivity is crucial:** To ensure fairness and accuracy, data analysis should be objective and consider all sides of the argument.
- **Critical thinking is essential:** Asking questions like who, what, where, when, how, and why helps to understand the context and potential biases in data.
- **Accurate representation matters:** Starting with an accurate representation of the population and collecting data objectively is essential for reliable results.

**Definitions:**

- **Context:** The circumstances or conditions that surround an event or situation.
- **Data bias:** A systematic error in data that favors certain outcomes over others.
- **Objectivity:** The ability to judge or interpret things in an impartial and unbiased way.
- **Critical thinking:** The ability to analyze information objectively and form judgments based on evidence.

**Overall, the video highlights the importance of critical thinking and objectivity when working with data. By understanding the context and potential biases in data, we can make more informed and data-driven decisions.**

**Additional Notes:**

- The video mentions the importance of asking questions to understand data better.
- The video also emphasizes the role of data analysts in putting data into context and recognizing biases.
- The video concludes by stating that understanding context is crucial for interpreting and understanding data.

# The importance of context

**Context** in data analytics is the condition and circumstances that surround and give meaning to the data. Context is important in data analytics because it helps make disorganized data accessible and understood. The fact is, data has little value if it is not paired with context.

Understanding the context behind the data can help us make it more meaningful at every stage of the data analysis process. For example, you might be able to make a few guesses about what you're looking at in the following table, but you couldn't be certain without more context.

| 2010 | 28000 |
| --- | --- |
| 2005 | 18000 |
| 2000 | 23000 |
| 1995 | 10000 |

On the other hand, if the first column was labeled to represent the years when a survey was conducted, and the second column showed the number of people who responded to that survey, then the table would start to make a lot more sense. Take this a step further, and you might notice that the survey is conducted every 5 years. This added context helps you understand why there are five-year gaps in the table.

| **Years (Collected every 5 years)** | **Respondents** |
| --- | --- |
| 2010 | 28000 |
| 2005 | 18000 |
| 2000 | 23000 |
| 1995 | 10000 |

**Context can turn raw data into meaningful information.** It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

- Who: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection
- What: The things in the world that data could have an impact on
- Where: The origin of the data
- When: The time when the data was created or collected
- Why: The motivation behind the creation or collection
- How: The method used to create or collect it

Understanding and including the context is important during each step of your analysis process, so it is a good idea to get comfortable with it early in your career. For example, when you collect data, you’ll also want to ask questions about the context to make sure that you understand the business and business process. During organization, the context is important for your naming conventions, how you choose to show relationships between variables, and what you choose to keep or leave out. And finally, when you present, it is important to include contextual information so that your stakeholders understand your analysis.

# Work with datasets

Kaggle is a data science platform that houses a variety of datasets. You will need to create a free account to begin exploring and analyzing different datasets. Then, this activity will provide an example of how to use a dataset to formulate SMART questions, create an SOW, and perform analytics in a spreadsheet. After that, you’ll have an opportunity to explore a dataset of your choice to formulate your own SMART questions, create your own SOW, and perform analytics in a spreadsheet that you can add to your professional portfolio.

1. Download [Lettuce Growth Days](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jjayfabor/lettuce-growth-days) from the Kaggle website. After you extract the files, open the lettuce_dataset CSV file in Google Sheets or Excel.
2. Analyze the dataset’s column names, values, and summary statistics (mean, median, quartiles, and min/max values), as well as contemplate goals to formulate SMART questions. SMART questions for the Lettuce Growth Days data could include:
    1. **Specific:** Is there a connection between humidity and temperature?
    2. **Measurable:** How much growth is normal or expected over a one-week period?
    3. **Action-oriented:** If total dissolved solids are increased when growing lettuce, will it shorten the time needed for the plants to reach maturity?
    4. **Relevant:** Based on the dataset, how can predictions about growth be made given the conditions?
    5. **Time-bound:** What is the date range for this dataset? Do we need an understanding of this data for next season?
3. Based on the SMART questions, create an SOW that outlines the analytics tasks. An example of an SOW for Lettuce Growth Days can be found in the [Lettuce dataframe: Example SOW](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifvROJg0le-k5kFtse129zHx4NzCCQE9/template/preview).
4. Perform basic analytics on the dataset. For the Lettuce Growth Days dataset, analytics could include:
    1. Converting Celsius to Farenheit
    2. Converting days to weeks
    3. Modifying the humidity column
    4. Creating a new spreadsheet to perform exploratory data analysis
