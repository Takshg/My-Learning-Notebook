### **Key Points:**

- **Data Types and Structures:**
    - **Qualitative Data:** Data that describes qualities or characteristics and cannot be easily measured or counted. Examples include movie titles, cast members, and genres.
    - **Quantitative Data:** Data that can be measured or counted and expressed as a number. Examples include movie budgets and box office revenue.
    - **Discrete Data:** Quantitative data that can be counted and has a limited number of values. Examples include the number of movies made by a specific studio or the number of awards won by a specific actor.
    - **Continuous Data:** Quantitative data that can be measured using a timer and can have any value within a range. Examples include the runtime of a movie or the temperature of a room.
    - **Nominal Data:** Qualitative data that categorizes information without a specific order. Examples include the genre of a movie or the country of origin.
    - **Ordinal Data:** Qualitative data that categorizes information with a specific order or ranking. Examples include the rating of a movie or the level of education of a person.
- **Internal vs. External Data:**
    - **Internal Data:** Data that is collected and owned by an organization.
    - **External Data:** Data that is collected and owned by another organization or individual.
- **Structured vs. Unstructured Data:**
    - **Structured Data:** Data that is organized in a specific format, such as rows and columns in a spreadsheet or a relational database.
    - **Unstructured Data:** Data that is not organized in a specific format, such as audio or video files.

# Data formats in practice

# Data formats in practice

- When you think about the word "format," a lot of things might come to mind. Think of an advertisement for your favorite store. You might find it in the form of a print ad, a billboard, or even a commercial. The information is presented in the format that works best for you to take it in. The format of a dataset is a lot like that, and choosing the right format will help you manage and use your data in the best way possible.

## Data format examples

- As with most things, it is easier for definitions to click when you can pair them with examples you might encounter on a daily basis. Review each data format’s definition first and then use the examples to lock in your understanding.

### **What is Structured Data?**

- Data organized in a **format like rows and columns**, often found in spreadsheets and databases.
- **Data elements**: Individual pieces of information within structured data, like names, account numbers, and addresses.
- **Data models**: Frameworks used to organize data elements and their relationships. They ensure consistency and provide a roadmap for understanding data.

### **Benefits of Structured Data:**

- **Easy to analyze**: Structured data integrates seamlessly with databases, allowing for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Visualization-friendly**: Can be directly applied to charts, graphs, and other visual representations for clear insights.
- **Consistent and reliable**: Data models ensure consistency and reliability, making data interpretation easier for stakeholders.

### **Applications of Structured Data:**

- **Spreadsheets**: Organize and analyze data in rows and columns.
- **Databases**: Store and manage large amounts of structured data efficiently.
- **Data analysis**: Structured data forms the basis for various analyses, leading to informed decision-making.
- **Data visualization**: Enables clear and impactful data visualizations for effective communication.

### **Key Points:**

- Structured data is the backbone of data analysis and visualization.
- Data models provide structure and organization to data elements.
- Spreadsheets and databases are common tools for working with structured data.
- Structured data facilitates efficient analysis and clear communication of insights.

### **Remember:**

- Most data you'll work with will be structured.
- Structured data is essential for effective data analysis and visualization.

# The effects of different structures

- Data is everywhere and it can be stored in lots of ways. Two general categories of data are:
    - **Structured data:** Organized in a certain format, such as rows and columns.
    - **Unstructured data:** Not organized in any easy-to-identify way.
- For example, when you rate your favorite restaurant online, you're creating structured data. But when you use Google Earth to check out a satellite image of a restaurant location, you're using unstructured data.
- Here's a refresher on the characteristics of structured and unstructured data:
    
    ![Untitled](Differentiate%20data%20formats%20and%20structures%2074a7098a817340fa8ee1f86af9337560/Untitled.png)
    

## Structured data

As we described earlier, **structured data** is organized in a certain format. This makes it easier to store and query for business needs. If the data is exported, the structure goes along with the data.

## Unstructured data

**Unstructured data** can’t be organized in any easily identifiable manner. And there is much more unstructured than structured data in the world. Video and audio files, text files, social media content, satellite imagery, presentations, PDF files, open-ended survey responses, and websites all qualify as types of unstructured data.

## The fairness issue

The lack of structure makes unstructured data difficult to search, manage, and analyze. But recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are beginning to change that. Now, the new challenge facing data scientists is making sure these tools are inclusive and unbiased. Otherwise, certain elements of a dataset will be more heavily weighted and/or represented than others. And as you're learning, an unfair dataset does not accurately represent the population, causing skewed outcomes, low accuracy levels, and unreliable analysis.

# Data modeling levels and techniques

- This reading introduces you to data modeling and different types of data models.
- Data models help keep data consistent and enable people to map out how data is organized. A basic understanding makes it easier for analysts and other stakeholders to make sense of their data and use it in the right ways.
- **Important note:** As a junior data analyst, you won't be asked to design a data model. But you might come across existing data models your organization already has in place.

## What is data modeling?

- **Data modeling** is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured.  These visual representations are called **data models**.
- You can think of data modeling as a blueprint of a house. At any point, there might be electricians, carpenters, and plumbers using that blueprint. Each one of these builders has a different relationship to the blueprint, but they all need it to understand the overall structure of the house.
- Data models are similar; different users might have different data needs, but the data model gives them an understanding of the structure as a whole.

## Levels of data modeling

- Each level of data modeling has a different level of detail.
    
    ![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CFnznQrXRhaZ850K1_YW7w_32345423f15a4115961a22948e080610_Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-2.28.52-PM.png?expiry=1716681600000&hmac=Xp9CIlqUpOzB08F-6c04-4zOEdZ4apY0Hf6bhoGTqT0)
    
    1. **Conceptual data modeling** gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details.
    2. **Logical data modeling** focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.
    3. **Physical data modeling** depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.

## Data-modeling techniques

- There are a lot of approaches when it comes to developing data models, but two common methods are the **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and the **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** diagram.
- ERDs are a visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model. UML diagrams are very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships.
- As a junior data analyst, you will need to understand that there are different data modeling techniques, but in practice, you will probably be using your organization’s existing technique.

## Data analysis and data modeling

- Data modeling can help you explore the high-level details of your data and how it is related across the organization’s information systems.
- Data modeling sometimes requires data analysis to understand how the data is put together; that way, you know how to map the data.
- And finally, data models make it easier for everyone in your organization to understand and collaborate with you on your data. This is important for you and everyone on your team!
