# All about thinking analytically

- Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step by step manner.

<aside>
💡 The five key aspects to analytical thinking:
  1. Visualization
  2. Strategy 
  3. Problem-orientation 
  4. Correlation
  5. Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

</aside>

1. ***Visualization*** is the graphical representation of information 
    - Some examples include graphs, maps or other design elements
    - Visualization is important because visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively
    - Think about it like this. If you are trying to explain the Grand Canyon to someone, using words would be much more challenging than showing them a picture. A visualization of the Grand Canyon would help you make your point much quicker.
2. ***Being strategic*** 
    - With so much data available, having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused and on track.
    - Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
    - Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect.
    - By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals.
3. ***Being problem-oriented*** 
    - Data analysts use a problem-oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems.
    - It’s all about keeping the problem top of mid throughout the entire project.
        - For example, say a data analyst is told about the problem of a warehouse constantly running out of supplies. They would move forward with different strategies and processes. But the number one goal would always be solving the problem of keeping inventory on the shelves.
    - Data analysts also ask a lot of questions. This helps improve communication and saves time while working on a solution.
        - An example of that would be surveying customers about their experiences using a product and building insights from those questions to improve their product.
4. Being able to identify a ***correlation*** between two or more pieces of data
    - A correlation is like a relationship. Maybe you notice a correlation between a rainier season leading to a high number of umbrellas being sold
    - But as you start identifying correlations in data, there's one thing you always want to keep in mind: **Correlation does not equal causation**
    - In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.
5. ***Big-picture thinking and detail-oriented*** 
    - This means being able to see the big picture as well as the details.
        - A jigsaw puzzle is a great way to think about this, big-picture thinking is like looking at a complete puzzle.
    - If you only focus on individual pieces, you wouldn’t be able to see past that, which is why big-picture thinking is so important.
    - It helps you zoom out and see possiblities and opportunities. This leads to exciting new ideas or innovations.
    - Detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan. In other words, the pieces that make up your puzzle.
        - There are all kinds of problems in the business world that can benefit from employees who have both a big-picture and a detail-oriented way of thinking.

# Explore core analytical skills

- The more ways you can think, the easier it is to think outside the box and come up with fresh ideas.
- But why is it important to think in different ways? Well because in data analysis, solutions are almost never right in front of you.
- You need to think critically to find out the right questions to ask. But you also need to think creatively to get new and unexpected answers.

### Root causes

- There are a lot of questions data analysts ask when they're on the hunt for a solution.
    - Here's one that will come up a lot: **What is the root cause of a problem?**
    - A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again.

### The Five Whys

- A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called the Five Whys.
    - In the Five Whys you ask “why” five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights.
    - Here’s an example of the Five Whys in action. Let’s say you wanted to make a blueberry pie but couldn’t find any blueberries. You've been trying to solve a problem by asking, why can't I make a blueberry pie? The answer will be, there are no blueberries at the store.
        - Why 1: Why can't I make a blueberry pie? The answer will be, there are no blueberries at the store.
        - Why 2: Why were there no blueberries at the store? Then you discover that the blueberry bushes don't have enough fruit this season.
        - Why 3: Why was there not enough fruit? This would lead to the fact that birds were eating all the berries.
        - Why 4: Why were the birds eating all the berries? The answer would be that, although the birds normally prefer mulberries and don't eat blueberries, the mulberry bush didn't produce fruit this season, so the birds are eating blueberries instead.
        - Why 5: Why did the mulberry bush not produce fruit this season? A late frost damaged the mulberry bushes, so it didn't produce any fruit.
        - You can't make a blueberry pie because of the late frost months ago. See how the Five Whys can reveal some very surprising root causes.

### Gaps in the process

- Another question commonly asked by data analysts is, **where are the gaps in our process?**
- For this, many people will use something called ***gap analysis***.
- **Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future.**
- Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient.
- The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

### What we didn’t consider before?

- A third question that data analysts ask a lot is, what did we not consider before?
- This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward.

# Use the five whys for root cause analysis

- You recently explored a case involving lacking the necessary ingredients to bake pies; now, you’ll go more in-depth with some business applications of the five whys technique to do root cause analysis.

### Boost customer service

- An online grocery store was receiving numerous customer service complaints about poor deliveries. To address this problem, a data analyst at the company asked their first “why?”
- **Why #1.** “Customers are complaining about poor grocery deliveries. Why?”
    - The data analyst began by reviewing the customer feedback more closely. They noted the vast majority of complaints dealt with products arriving damaged. So, they asked “why?” again.
- **Why #2.** “Products are arriving damaged. Why?”
    - To answer this question, the data analyst continued exploring the customer feedback. It turned out that many customers said products were not packaged properly.
- **Why #3.** “Products are not packaged properly. Why?”
    - After asking their third “why,” the data analyst did some further detective work. They ultimately learned that their company’s grocery packers were not adequately trained on packing procedures.
- **Why #4. “**Grocery packers are not adequately trained. Why?”
    - This “why” enabled the data analyst to uncover that nearly 35% of all packers were new to the company. They had not yet had the chance to complete all required training, yet they were already being asked to pack groceries for customer orders.
- **Why #5. “**Packers have not completed required training. Why?”
    - This final “why?” led the data analyst to find out that the human resources department had not provided necessary training to any newly hired packers. This was because HR was in the middle of reworking the training program. Rather than training new hires using the old system, they had provided them with a quick one-page guide, which was insufficient.
- So, in this example, the root cause of the problem was that HR had not completed the training program updates and was using a less-thorough guide to train new packers. Fortunately, this was a problem that the grocer could control. And thanks to the data analyst’s work, they provided more support to the HR department to complete the training and retrain all newly hired grocery packers!

### Advance quality control

- An irrigation company was experiencing an increase in the number of defects in their water pumps. The company's data team used the five whys to analyze the situation:
- **Why #1.** “There has been an increase in the number of defects in water pumps. Why?”
    - To answer this question, the data team set up a meeting with shop floor engineers. They asked for some insights into machine performance and manufacturing processes. After some exploration, it was discovered that the machines used to produce the pumps were not properly calibrated.
- **Why #2.** “The machines are not properly calibrated. Why?”
    - After more brainstorming with the engineering team, it was determined that the machines were miscalibrated during the last maintenance cycle.
- **Why #3.** “The machines were miscalibrated during maintenance. Why?”
    - Next, the data team investigated the procedures involved with machine calibration. They found out that the current method was inappropriate for the machines.
- **Why #4.** “The calibration method is inappropriate for the machines. Why?”
    - This “why” led them to discover that the company had recently installed new software in their machines. Because it was a minor software upgrade, the engineers didn’t realize it would affect calibration. They didn’t have the information they needed to properly calibrate the upgraded machines.
- **Why #5.** “The engineers don’t have the information they need to calibrate the upgraded machines. Why?”
    - The fifth and final “why” turned up even more evidence: The installation team had upgraded machine software, but had failed to share the corresponding calibration procedures with the engineers.
- So, in this example, the root cause of the problem was that the engineers lacked important information about how to calibrate the machines using the new software system. The solution was found, and the irrigation company was able to implement it right away. Soon, the engineers had the necessary calibration instructions, and the pump defects were eliminated!

## Key takeaways

The five whys is a powerful tool for root cause analysis. It’s simple, effective, and a great way to collaborate with colleagues and learn about other areas of the business. Plus, the five whys can be used to analyze problems in any industry, helping organizations of all kinds identify and fix business problems. As a data professional, you can turn to the five whys whenever you feel stumped by a problem and need to approach it from a different perspective.

# Data drives successful outcomes

- Data analysts can tap into the power of data to do all kinds of amazing things. With data, they can gain valuable insights, verify their theories or assumptions, better understand opportunities and challenges, support an objective, help make a plan, and much more. In business, data-driven decision-making can improve the results in a lot of different ways.
    - For example, say a dairy farmer wants to start making and selling ice cream. They could guess what flavors customers would like, but there's a better way to get the information. The farmer could survey people and ask them what flavors they prefer. This gives the farmer the data they need to pick ice cream flavors people will enjoy.
    - Here's another example. Let's say the president of an organization is curious about what perks employees value most. She asked the human resources director who says people value casual dress code. It's a gut feeling, but the HR director backs it up with the fact that he sees a lot of people wearing jeans and t-shirts. But what if this company were to use a more structured employee feedback process, such as a survey? It might reveal that employees actually enjoy free public transportation cards the most. The human resources director just didn't realize that because he drives to work.
- These are just some of the benefits of data-driven decision-making. It gives you greater confidence about your choice and your abilities to address business challenges. It helps you become more proactive when an opportunity presents itself, and it saves you time and effort when working towards a goal.

## Data-driven decisions link to the five key skills of a data analysts

- First, think about curiosity and context. The more you learn about the power of data, the more curious you're likely to become. You'll start to see patterns and relationships in everyday life, whether you're reading the news, watching a movie, or going to an appointment across town. The analysts take their thinking a step further by using context to make predictions, research answers, and eventually draw conclusions about what they've discovered. This natural process is a great first step in becoming more data-driven.
- Having a technical mindset comes next. Everyone has instincts, or as in the case of our human resources director example, gut feelings. Data analysts are no different. They have gut feelings too. But they've trained themselves to build on those feelings and use a more technical approach to explore them. They do this by always seeking out the facts, putting them to work through analysis, and using the insights they gain to make informed decisions.
- Next, we come to data design, which has a strong connection to data-driven decision-making. To put it simply, designing your data so that it is organized in a logical way makes it easy for data analysts to access, understand, and make the most of available information. And it's important to keep in mind that data design doesn't just apply to databases. This kind of thinking can work with all sorts of real-life situations too. The basic idea is this. If you make decisions that are informed by data, you are more likely to make more informed and effective decisions.
- The final ability is data strategy, which incorporates the people, processes, and tools used to solve a problem. This is a big one to remember because data strategy gives you a high-level view of the path you need to take to achieve your goals. Also, data-driven decision-making isn't a one-person job. It's much more likely to be successful if everyone is on board and on the same page, so it's important to make sure specific procedures are in place and that your technology being used is aligned with your data-driven strategy.
