    **Accuracy:** The degree to which the data conforms to the actual entity being measured or described
    
    **Completeness:** The degree to which the data contains all desired components or measures
    
    **Confidence interval:**  A range of values that conveys how likely a statistical estimate reflects the population
    
    **Confidence level:** The probability that a sample size accurately reflects the greater population
    
    **Consistency:** The degree to which data is repeatable from different points of entry or collection
    
    **Cross-field validation:** A process that ensures certain conditions for multiple data fields are satisfied
    
    **Data constraints:** The criteria that determine whether a piece of a data is clean and valid
    
    **Data integrity:** The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its life cycle
    
    **Data manipulation:** The process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read
    
    **Data range:** Numerical values that fall between predefined maximum and minimum values
    
    **Data replication:** The process of storing data in multiple locations
    
    **DATEDIF:** A spreadsheet function that calculates the number of days, months, or years between two dates
    
    **Estimated response rate**: The average number of people who typically complete a survey
    
    **Hypothesis testing:** A process to determine if a survey or experiment has meaningful results
    
    **Mandatory:** A data value that cannot be left blank or empty
    
    **Margin of error**: The maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population
    
    **Random sampling:** A way of selecting a sample from a population so that every possible type of the sample has an equal chance of being chosen
