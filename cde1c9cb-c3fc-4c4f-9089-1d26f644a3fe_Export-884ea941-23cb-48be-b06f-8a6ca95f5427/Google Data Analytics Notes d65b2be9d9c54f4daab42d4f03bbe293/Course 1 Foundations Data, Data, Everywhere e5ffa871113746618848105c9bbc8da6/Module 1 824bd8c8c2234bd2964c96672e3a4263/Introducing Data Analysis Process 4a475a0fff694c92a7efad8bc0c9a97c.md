## The data analysis process breakdown

## Breakdown

1. Ask: Business challenge, objective, or question 
    - You’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be answered.
    - It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders
2. Prepare: data generation generation, collection, storage, and data management 
    - You’ll find and collect the data you’ll need to answer your questions.
    - You’ll find identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it’s accurate and useful for answering your questions.
3. Process: data cleaning and data integrity
    - This is when you’ll clean and organize your data
    - Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that’s easier to work with.
    - Essentially, you’re that data is ready before you begin analysis
4. Analyze: data exploration, visualization and analysis 
    - When you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions
    - Depending on the situation and the data, this could invloved tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns
5. Share: communication and interpreting results
    - When you present your findings to decision makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations.
    - As a part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include.
    - Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R
6. Act: Putting insights to work to solve the problem
    - Putting the data insights into action.
    - This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website or any other action that solves the initial problem.

## Example

- This is how a group of data analysts used the process of data analysis to improve business processes and their workplace.
- An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of the first year of the job.
- The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: ***How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?***

### Ask

- First the analysts need to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result
- To determine these things, these **asked** effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of the analysis
- They asked these kinds of questions:
    1. What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job? 
    2. Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to historical data?
    3. Do you believe managers with a higher retention rates offer employees something extra or unique? 
    4. What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
    5. By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year? 

### Prepare

- The group built a three month timeline and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties.
- They identified what data they need to achieve the successful result identified in the ask step
- They did the following to **prepare:**
    1. They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation.
    2. They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside the group wouldn't have access to the raw data, but could view summarized or aggregated data. For example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable.
    3. They finalized what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them.

### Process

- The data analysts ensured that the employees knew how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected.
- To maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively the analysts:
    1. Restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts 
    2. Cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses 
    3. They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security 

### Analyze

- From the completed surveys, the analysts **discovered** that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction
- These were their findings:
    - Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company.
    - Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with company.

### Share

- Just as making sure the data was protected, the analysts were also careful with **sharing the report.**
- This is how they shared their findings
    - They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey
    - They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture
    - They asked managers to personally deliver the results to their teams
- This process gave the managers an opportunity to **communicate the results** in the right context.

### Act

- The last stage of the process for the analysts to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to **implement changes and take actions** based on the findings.
- These were their recommendations
    - Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices
    - Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year.
