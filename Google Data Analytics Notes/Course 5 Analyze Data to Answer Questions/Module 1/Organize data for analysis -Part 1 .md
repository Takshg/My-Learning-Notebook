# The analysis process

**Key Points:**

- **Analysis:** The process of making sense of collected data to identify trends and relationships, ultimately answering the question you're asking.
- **4 Phases of Analysis:**
    - **Organize data:** Prepare the data for analysis by ensuring it's clean and well-structured.
    - **Format and adjust data:** Make the data easier to understand and analyze by filtering, sorting, and adjusting its presentation.
    - **Get input from others:** Seek perspectives from others familiar with the data or topic to gain valuable insights and avoid potential pitfalls.
    - **Transform data:** Identify relationships and patterns within the data, making calculations to draw conclusions and answer your question.

**Definitions:**

- **Analysis:** The process of examining and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and answer questions.
- **Data:** Information collected and organized for analysis.
- **Trends:** Patterns or tendencies observed within data over time or across different groups.
- **Relationships:** Connections or associations between different data points.
- **Calculations:** Mathematical operations performed on data to derive meaningful results.

**Real-World Example:**

The video uses the example of buying a wedding gift for Zara. By analyzing the data on her online registry, the learner can:

- **Organize:** Ensure the gift list is complete and accurate.
- **Format and adjust:** Filter and sort the list by price to find gifts within their budget.
- **Get input from others:** Check if any gifts have already been purchased by other guests.
- **Transform data:** Identify the best gift option based on price, availability, and potential duplicates.

**Benefits of Analysis:**

- Makes better decisions based on data-driven insights.
- Improves problem-solving skills.
- Enhances critical thinking abilities.
- Provides a deeper understanding of complex situations.

**Conclusion:**

Analysis is a crucial skill for anyone who wants to make informed decisions based on data. By following the four phases of analysis, you can effectively extract meaningful insights from data and answer your questions with confidence.

# Always a need to organize

**Key Points:**

- **Importance of Data Organization:**
    - Organization is crucial throughout the data analysis process.
    - How data is classified and structured impacts your findings.
    - Effective organization helps you capture and collect the necessary information.
- **Data Organization in Tables:**
    - Tables are the primary way to organize data for analysis.
    - They categorize data into relevant fields and subject areas.
    - Example: A database with tables for car dealerships, product details, and repair parts.
- **Using Tables to Make Decisions:**
    - Tables help you decide which data to pull for specific objectives.
    - Example: Determining the total number of cars sold for a particular brand or finding a repair part for a specific car model.
- **Data Types and Variables:**
    - Tables help you determine the required variables and their data types.
    - Example: Converting a purchase price column to a FLOAT for numerical calculations.
- **Data Organization in Spreadsheets:**
    - Ensure effective organization of columns and rows in spreadsheets.
    - Hide unnecessary or duplicate columns.
- **Sorting and Filtering:**
    - Sorting and filtering are affected by data types.
    - These techniques help you find the specific data you need.
- **Importance of Data Format:**
    - Always be prepared to adjust data format during analysis.
    - Correct formatting ensures accurate results.

**Definitions:**

- **Data Organization:** The process of structuring and classifying data for efficient analysis.
- **Tables:** A structured way to organize data into rows and columns, representing different categories and fields.
- **Variables:** Specific data points within a table that represent different attributes or measurements.
- **Data Types:** The format of data, such as numbers, text, or dates.
- **Sorting:** Arranging data in a specific order, such as alphabetical or numerical.
- **Filtering:** Selecting specific data based on defined criteria.
