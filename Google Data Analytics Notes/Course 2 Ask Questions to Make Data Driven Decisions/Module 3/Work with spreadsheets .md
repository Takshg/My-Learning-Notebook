# Get to work with spreadsheets

**Introduction:**

- Data analysts spend a lot of time organizing data and performing calculations.
- Spreadsheets are a powerful tool that can help data analysts with these tasks.

**Key Points:**

- **Spreadsheets can be used for a variety of tasks:**
    - Organizing data
    - Performing calculations
    - Creating visualizations
- **Data analysts use spreadsheets to organize data in a variety of ways:**
    - Creating pivot tables: A pivot table is a dynamic table that summarizes and groups data in a way that makes it easier to analyze.
    - Sorting and filtering data: Sorting data allows you to arrange it in a specific order, while filtering data allows you to select only the data that you are interested in.
    - Using formulas and functions: Formulas and functions are used to perform calculations on data.
- **Spreadsheets can be used to analyze data and make data-driven decisions:**
    - Identifying trends: A trend is a general direction of movement or change over time.
    - Identifying patterns: A pattern is a repeated sequence of events or data points.
    - Identifying outliers: An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points.

**Example:**

The video uses the example of a construction company that needs to analyze its expenses. The data analyst uses a spreadsheet to organize the data, create pivot tables, and perform calculations. This allows the data analyst to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. This information can then be used to make data-driven decisions about the company's expenses.

**Conclusion:**

Spreadsheets are a powerful tool that can be used by data analysts to organize, analyze, and visualize data. This can help data analysts to make data-driven decisions.

**Definitions:**

- **Data analysis:** The process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
- **Spreadsheet:** A computer program that allows users to organize data in rows and columns and perform calculations on that data.
- **Pivot table:** A dynamic table that summarizes and groups data in a way that makes it easier to analyze.
- **Formula:** A set of instructions that tells a spreadsheet how to perform a calculation.
- **Function:** A built-in formula that performs a specific task.
- **Trend:** A general direction of movement or change over time.
- **Pattern:** A repeated sequence of events or data points.
- **Outlier:** A data point that is significantly different from the other data points.

# Spreadsheet and the data life cycle

To better understand the benefits of using spreadsheets in data analytics, let’s explore how they relate to each phase of the data life cycle: **plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive,** and **destroy**.

- **Plan** for the users who will work within a spreadsheet by developing organizational standards. This can mean formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points. When you take the time to set these standards, you will improve communication, ensure consistency, and help people be more efficient with their time.
- **Capture** data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database. This data will automatically be updated in the spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as current and accurate as possible.
- **Manage** different kinds of data with a spreadsheet. This can involve storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure.
- **Analyze** data in a spreadsheet to help make better decisions. Some of the most common spreadsheet analysis tools include formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear, easy-to-understand visuals.
- **Archive** any spreadsheet that you don’t use often, but might need to reference later with built-in tools. This is especially useful if you want to store historical data before it gets updated.
- **Destroy** your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data is destroyed properly.

# Step by Step: Basic Spreadsheet Tasks

This reading outlines the steps the instructor performs in the next video, [Basic spreadsheet tasks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/lecture/lpuHf/step-by-step-in-spreadsheets). In the video, the instructor explains how to organize a spreadsheet and demonstrates how organizing data helps you understand it more fully.

Keep this step-by-step guide open as you watch the video. It can serve as a helpful reference if you need additional context or clarification while following the video steps. This is not a graded activity, but you can complete these steps to practice the skills demonstrated in the video.

**What you’ll need**

If you’d like to follow along with the first two examples in this video, choose a spreadsheet tool and open a blank sheet.

If you would like to access the other spreadsheet the instructor uses in this video, click the link to the dataset to create a copy. If you don’t have a Google account, you may download the data directly from the attachments below.

## Example 1: Open a new spreadsheet

1. Open a new blank spreadsheet.
2. In the title bar, name it: Population, Latin and Caribbean Countries, 2010-2019.

## Example 2: Create a new folder

Organizing files in folders helps you locate the correct file more easily.

1. Select **File**, then select **Move**.
2. Select the **New Folder** icon.
3. Name the new folder **Population Data**.
4. Select the **checkmark** icon to move the spreadsheet to its new folder.

## Example 3: Change cell size

Change the format of your spreadsheet to make it easier to understand.

1. Open the **Population of Latin and Caribbean Countries** spreadsheet and select [Use Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZlhSF9X-E-7LgIBXdEEgyw1Czm0dQvjJ/template/preview).
2. Select the cell where the column and row headers intersect.

3.	Widen all columns by clicking and dragging the boundary between **Columns D** and **E**.

## Example 4: Make attributes stand out

Adding formatting to cells that contain attribute labels help the attributes stand out.

1. Select cell **1** to select the entire first row.
2. Select the paint can icon called **Fill color** and choose a color. This will fill the cells in the row with your selected color, making the attributes stand out.
3. Select the **B** icon from the menu bar to bold the labels.

## Example 5: Add a column

If you need to add a new attribute to your spreadsheet, add a new column.

1. Select cell **I1**.
2. From the **Insert** menu, select **Column right** from the menu bar. This inserts a column to the right of **Column I**.

## Example 6: Delete a column

Organize your data by deleting an attribute.

1. Right click cell **J1**.
2. Select **Delete column**. This deletes the column and causes all the other columns to shift to the left.

## Example 7: Add a border

Adding borders helps distinguish cells from one another.

1. Select the cell in the top-left corner of the image, above **1** and to the left of **A**.
2. Select the **Borders** icon from the menu.
3. Select **All borders**.
