# Step-by-Step: Make spreadsheets your friend

- This reading outlines the steps the instructor performs in the next video, [Make spreadsheets your friend.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/xUZNB/columns-and-rows-and-cells-oh-my) In the video, the instructor demonstrates some spreadsheet basics and discusses how to use them to organize and analyze data.

## Definitions:

- Attributte: An attribute is a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table. More commonly, attributes are referred to as column names, column labels, headers, or the header row.
- Observation: In a dataset, a row is also called an observation. An observation includes all of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table.
- A formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific action using the data in a spreadsheet. To do this, the formula uses cell references for the values it's calculating.

## Example 1: Get started

Enter basic data:

1. Begin with a new spreadsheet.
2. Select cell **A2**.
3. Enter your **first name**.
4. Select cell **B2**.
5. Enter your **last name**.

Adjust the size of rows and columns:

To make the text fit in the rows and columns, adjust their sizes. Use either of the following methods:

1. If your name is longer than the width of the column, **select and drag** the right edge of the corresponding column until it fits.
2. To **wrap text**, select the cells, columns, or rows with text that you want to reformat.
3. Select the **Format** menu.
4. Under **Wrapping**, select **Wrap**.

## Example 2: Add labels

Add labels, or attributes, to help you keep track of the data:

1. Select cell **A1**.
2. Enter **First Name**.
3. Select cell **B1**.
4. Enter **Last Name**.
5. Select cells **A1** and **B1**. To do this, select a single cell and drag your cursor over to the other cell to include it in the selection.
6. From the toolbar, select the **bold icon**.

## Example 3: Add more attributes and data

Add more attributes and data to your spreadsheet:

1. Select cell **C1** and enter **Siblings**.
2. Select cell **D1** and enter **Favorite Color**.
3. Select cell **E1** and enter **Favorite Dessert**.
4. Select **all three cells** and make them bold by selecting the **bold icon** from the toolbar.
5. Adjust the columns to fit the new text.
6. Enter the corresponding data in cells **C2**, **D2**, and **E2** (your number of siblings, favorite color, and favorite dessert).
7. Add data about two more people in **rows 3 and 4**. These can be people you know or people you’ve just made up.

## Example 4: Organize your data

One way to organize your data is by sorting it.

1. Select all columns that contain data. There are a few ways to select multiple cells:
    1. To select nonadjacent cells and/or cell ranges, hold the **Command** (Mac) or **Ctrl** (PC) **key** and select the cells.
    2. To select a range of cells, hold the **Shift** key and either drag your cursor over which cells you want to include or use the arrow keys to select a range.
    3. Select a single cell and drag your cursor over the cells you want to include in your selection.
2. Select the **Data** menu.
3. Select **Sort range**, then select **Advanced range sorting options**.
4. In the **Advanced range sorting options** window, select the checkbox for **Data has header row**. Make sure that **A to Z** is selected.
5. Select the **Sort by** drop-down menu, then select **Siblings**.
6. Select **Sort**. This will organize the spreadsheet by the number of siblings, from lowest to highest.

## Example 5: Use a formula

Spreadsheets enable data professionals to analyze data. In this example, the instructor uses a formula to calculate a sum.

1. Select the next empty cell in the **Siblings** column (**C5**).
2. Enter the formula **=C2+C3+C4**.
3. Press **Enter** on your keyboard to complete the formula.
4. The formula calculates the total number of siblings.

# Hands-on activity: Generate a chart from a spreadsheet

## Activity Overview

- At this point in the course, you’ve explored how spreadsheets can be used to support data-driven business decisions. In this activity, you will use a spreadsheet to make a simple chart. By the time you’re done, you’ll understand how to create a simple graphical representation of information. Data analysts use this skill to make reports, presentations, infographics, and more engaging and accessible.

## **Scenario**

- Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

### **The scenario: Analyze patterns in monthly sales**

- To help determine optimal inventory and staffing levels, your company has asked you to analyze total sales trends for the last three years. Because your firm relies on tourists for the bulk of its sales, leaders know that demand for inventory and staffing requirements vary based on the tourist season. They have asked you to identify peak months to help with forecasting requirements for next year. To do this, you'll create a chart.

### Step 1 & 2: Accessing the template

- Open and Access the monthly sales spreadsheet

[Monthly sales template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xn5e9ptvVKL5NGlIy3N3bq29_sR79FaOGm7MZrMPRTg/edit?usp=drivesdk)

### Step 3 : Review the data

- This spreadsheet contains total sales data for each month beginning in January 2021 and ending in December 2023. A portion of the spreadsheet is shown below.

### Step 4: Create a chart

- To make it easier to understand monthly sales trends, use these steps to create a chart:
    1. Select cell **A1**.
    2. Choose **Insert > Chart**. Google Sheets inserts a chart to the right of the data. By default, Google Sheets creates a line chart.
    3. Notice that Google Sheets generated a title automatically for the chart, “Total Sales vs. Month,” and added labels of “Total Sales,” for the vertical axis, and “Month” for the horizontal axis. It also automatically opens the **Chart editor** panel on the right side of the window, with the **Setup** tab opened.
    
    ![Untitled](Master%20Spreadsheet%20Basics%208d367734913647418dcb0ca9b96cfbbe/Untitled%201.png)
    

### Step 5: Adjust the chart

- Use the **Chart editor** panel to make changes to the chart. In the **Setup** tab, you can change the chart type, data range, axis labels, and more. For example, the chart type drop-down list changes the type of chart from line chart to a different style, such as a bar chart. In the **Customize** tab, you can change many other options, such as the chart’s style.
- If the **Chart editor** panel isn’t open, double-click on the chart to open it. Then, change the various components of the chart by selecting them within the chart or by navigating to them from the **Chart editor** panel.
- In this example, change the chart title to “Monthly sales.” Follow these steps:
    1. If necessary, open the **Chart editor** panel by double-clicking on the chart.
    2. In the **Chart editor** panel, select the **Customize** tab.
    3. Expand the **Chart & axis titles** section.
    4. Verify that the **Chart title** is selected from the dropdown, then change the title to **Monthly sales**. Your chart will nowdisplay the title “Monthly sales”
    5. If you’re using Microsoft Excel, double-click on the title in the chart to edit directly.
