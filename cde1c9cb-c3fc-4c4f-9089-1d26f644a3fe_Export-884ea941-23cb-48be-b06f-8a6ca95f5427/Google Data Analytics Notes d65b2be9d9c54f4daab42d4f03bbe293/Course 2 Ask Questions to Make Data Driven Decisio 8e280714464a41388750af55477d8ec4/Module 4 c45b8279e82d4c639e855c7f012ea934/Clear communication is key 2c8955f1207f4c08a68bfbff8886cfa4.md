# Use multiple communication strategies reach your audience

Being able to communicate in multiple formats is a key skill for data analysts. Listening, speaking, presenting, and writing skills will help you succeed in your projects and in your career. This reading covers effective communication strategies, including examples of clearly worded emails for common situations.

Here's an important first tip: Know your audience! When you communicate your analysis and recommendations as a data analyst, it's vital to keep your audience in mind.

Be sure to answer these four important questions related to your audience:

1. **Who is your audience?**
2. **What do they already know?**
3. **What do they need to know?**
4. **How can you best communicate what they need to know?**

## Project example

As a data analyst, you'll get plenty of requests and questions through email. Let’s walk through an example of how you might approach answering one of these emails. Assume you're a data analyst working at a company that develops mobile apps. Let's start by reviewing answers to the four audience questions we just covered:

Kiri, Product Development Project Manager

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7s3ZbdPmSHWN2W3T5mh1tQ_15406e28294149a0b1cb0bb30f688880_DA_C2M4L3R1_P1_B.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=lSnyQjoWwRfyeNcX73zwW5EnS7LEdfa5DPimISSOIno)

Kiri received updates about our project from its planning stages, including the most recent project report**,** sent two weeks ago.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_vgQoaAtQ7S4EKGgLaO0QA_9c20b97e2d9c427898d939d042ceb6eb_DA_C2M4L3R1_P1_C.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=A3FOx7a2KWJu6TZz14kTc7fjOmMQOkb7cg82JrdLirc)

Kiri needs an update on the analysis project’s progress and needs to know that the executive team approved changes to the data and timeline. You know that adding a new variable to the analysis will impact the current project timeline. Kiri will need to change the project’s milestones and completion date.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/rQwnZK5hSVOMJ2SuYUlTLA_ea792b49af39461293197cf541a48e0f_DA_C2M4L3R1_P1_D.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=D5VfCdrGSLwX5lsf-y-jAHEWtXW5_9CItJxte3eGpQY)

You can start by sending an email update to Kiri with the latest timeline for the project, but a meeting might be necessary if she wants to talk through her concerns about missing a deadline.

## Updated timeline email sample

After answering the audience questions, you have the key building blocks you need to write an email to Kiri. Here's an example of how these questions can help organize the flow of the email message:

Hello Kiri, (who is your audience?)

Thank you for your email about the app analysis project's status. I understand you're concerned about how adding this new data will impact the project timeline, and I'd be glad to provide as much information about the project status as I can. (What do they already know? )

We can include the new data that you've suggested however, we'll need time to collect and incorporate it into our analysis. As a result, it will take an additional two weeks to include the new data, which changes our analysis project timeline. (What do they need to know?)

I plan to send out a full report on Monday. This report will include the finalized timeline and share the latest findings, including any new insights we've found.

I understand you're waiting on our report, and I want to make sure that we're able to get you the information you need. If you'd like to meet before the next report, please let me know what time would work best for you. (How can you best communicate what they need to know?)

Thank you,
(your first name)

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hAhepVrCRq6IXqVawjauBw_669dfe6c4b35405dada09ead335d511c_Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-11.35.49-AM.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=zYsUBCRkG7sYNEuV3WESmPC-MeKp99HgAwJiPbwfiQ8)

After receiving your email, Kiri will have a clearer view of the changes to the analysis project and will be able to make adjustments to work with the new timeline.

## Project follow-up email sample

After the next report is completed, you can also send out a project update offering more information. The email could look like this:

Hello Kiri,

The app analysis report has been released, and I wanted to let you know that we are meeting all deadlines in our new timeline.

I've attached a copy of the report so that you can see the results. Analysis with our new data has been included in the report, along with more details about the next steps.

Please pass this along to your team, and let me know if you need any more information.

Thank you,
[your first name]

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/R-7sfTANRP-u7H0wDQT_kA_f555fa6929e144a28eea2ad40f1251a7_Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-11.38.12-AM.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=3G8rVnKUaQggmHAly5pUkPXUE2JngKKVubeb2NKP2m8)

Good communication keeps stakeholders updated on progress and ultimately helps prevent problems. Carefully worded responses are key. Whether you gather and address feedback using email, meetings, or reports, everyone you work with will know what to expect. As a result, they will be able to better manage their own schedules, resources, and teams.

# Navigate expectations and realistic project goals

**Key Points:**

- **Data limitations:** Sometimes you don't have access to the data you need, your data sources aren't aligned, or your data is unclean. This can affect your analysis and communication with stakeholders.
- **Balancing expectations:** It's important to balance stakeholder expectations with what is actually possible for a project. This means setting realistic goals and communicating clearly about potential problems.
- **Setting a timeline:** Communicate a high-level schedule with different phases of the project and their approximate start dates. This helps stakeholders plan accordingly and avoids overpromising and missing deadlines.
- **Communicating problems:** If you run into a problem, let your stakeholders know as soon as possible. This allows them to make necessary changes and adjust the timeline if needed.
- **Managing stakeholder requests:** If stakeholders want to add variables or change the project scope, communicate the impact on the timeline, model, and other aspects of the project. Help them understand the pros and cons of their requests so they can make informed decisions.
- **Clear communication:** Be realistic and objective in your communication. This helps stakeholders understand the limitations and have confidence in your ability to achieve the project goals.

**Definitions:**

- **Data limitations:** Factors that restrict your ability to access, analyze, or interpret data.
- **Realistic goals:** Goals that are achievable given the available resources and time.
- **Objective communication:** Communication that is factual and unbiased.

# How to communicate with stakeholders

**Key Points:**

- **Data analysis takes time:** Setting expectations with stakeholders about the time required for data analysis is crucial.
- **Data doesn't always answer everything:** Acknowledge that data has limitations and may not provide all the answers.
- **Ask questions to understand the data:** Use surveys or other methods to gather insights beyond what the data directly reveals.
- **Communicate your findings effectively:** Explain your theories and the evidence supporting them, even if you can't be 100% certain.
- **Data can make a difference:** Using data to improve processes and help people can be incredibly rewarding.

# The data tradeoff: Speed vs. Accuracy

**Balancing Speed and Accuracy:**

- While we often desire instant answers, rushing can compromise accuracy, especially in data analysis.
- The video emphasizes the need to balance speed with accuracy, ensuring the right answers are provided even if it takes more time.

**Reframing Questions and Outlining Problems:**

- Instead of simply providing quick answers, data analysts should reframe questions and outline the problem, challenges, potential solutions, and timeframe.
- This approach helps stakeholders understand the context and complexity of the issue, leading to more informed decisions.

**Structured Thinking and Scope of Work:**

- Starting with a clear understanding of stakeholders' expectations and a well-defined scope of work is crucial.
- This ensures everyone is on the same page regarding deliverables, timelines, and milestones.

**Setting Realistic Expectations:**

- When facing pressure for quick answers, data analysts should confidently set realistic expectations based on the scope of work.
- This helps manage expectations and avoid compromising accuracy for speed.

**Understanding the Real Problem:**

- Often, stakeholders may not know exactly what they need. Data analysts should take the time to understand the underlying problem and its context.
- This involves gathering additional information, asking clarifying questions, and potentially conducting further analysis.

**Communicating Effectively:**

- Clear and open communication is essential for successful collaboration.
- Data analysts should communicate about problems, potential solutions, and different expectations to move projects forward.

**Example:**

The video provides an example of a VP of HR requesting data on training course completion rates. Instead of simply providing the data, the analyst reframes the question and outlines the problem, challenges, and potential solutions. This leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the issue and better decision-making.

# Limitations of data

Data is powerful, but it has its limitations. Has someone’s personal opinion found its way into the numbers? Is your data telling the whole story? Part of being a great data analyst is knowing the limits of data and planning for them. This reading explores how you can do that.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ohFIriarTOeRSK4mq2znSw_6de4842ad15d44d29a5ab26b4fcb8575_Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-9.56.57-AM.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=xPVTSac3YqlfKQNpg-ByEMGqAbxZixmk5kixbm3DYa4)

If you have incomplete or nonexistent data, you might realize during an analysis that you don't have enough data to reach a conclusion. Or, you might even be solving a different problem altogether! For example, suppose you are looking for employees who earned a particular certificate but discover that certification records go back only two years at your company. You can still use the data, but you will need to make the limits of your analysis clear. You might be able to find an alternate source of the data by contacting the company that led the training. But to be safe, you should be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cCe9fD09SsGnvXw9PQrBhw_a5c8ac8d835f46ee895656bb358e40eb_Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.04.48-AM.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=A5JmPNNJT3NRrLnQ_V0NmOVxeja3vaTjnSIekFReP38)

If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another. For example, if a metric is the total number of trainees in a certificate program, you could have one team that counts every person who registered for the training, and another team that counts only the people who completed the program. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between teams are meaningful and insightful.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AMJJ0eJzRIOCSdHic9SDUw_5de6d3376ccb4a5fb236ee3986b1626a_Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.05.04-AM.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=r86FElnyFFBJyZ7inBaVT348Kk8C6fPBNFRMgy0sEWM)

Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When you find and fix the errors - while tracking the changes you made - you can avoid a data disaster. You will learn how to clean data later in the training.

Avinash Kaushik, a Digital Marketing Evangelist for Google, has lots of great tips for data analysts in his [blog: Occam's Razor](http://www.kaushik.net/). Below are some of the best practices he recommends for good data storytelling:

- **Compare the same types of data**: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics.
- **Visualize with care**: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.
- **Leave out needless graphs:** If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.
- **Test for statistical significance:** Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.
- **Pay attention to sample size**: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_695L7lPStSveS-5T7rUvQ_18d6d31218be4223a666fe2b1e5dea35_Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.05.29-AM.png?expiry=1716508800000&hmac=ygZ2raakFp6JhOmgMnvkt5N5ffjOHHWraHkTq7KRWpg)

In any organization, a big part of a data analyst’s role is making sound judgments. When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data. Data is an extremely powerful tool for decision-making, but if it is incomplete, misaligned, or hasn’t been cleaned, then it can be misleading. Take the necessary steps to make sure that your data is complete and consistent. Clean the data before you begin your analysis to save yourself and possibly others a great amount of time and effort.
