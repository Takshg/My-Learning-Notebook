# Weave data into your presentation

[index (55).mp4](The%20art%20and%20science%20of%20presentations%203d838cf033144a3b92da0b3388d92d55/index_(55).mp4)

**Key Points:**

- **Data Presentation:** This video focuses on how to effectively present data during presentations to help your audience understand and interpret your findings.
- **Data Framing:** It's important to frame your data by explaining what data was used, if any new data has emerged, and if different data is needed for specific questions.
- **Hypothesis:** Establish your initial hypothesis early in the presentation to provide context for your data.
- **Visualization Examples:** Use clear and concise examples and visualizations to help your audience understand your data.
- **McCandless Method:** This method for data presentation moves from general to specific, helping your audience understand your data visualizations effectively.
- **Steps of the McCandless Method:**
    1. **Introduce the graphic by name.**
    2. **Answer obvious questions your audience might have.**
    3. **State the insight your data viz provides.**
    4. **Call out data to support that insight.**
    5. **Explain why it matters to your audience.**
- **Self-Check:** Ask yourself if each data point or chart supports the key takeaway you want your audience to remember.

**Definitions:**

- **Data Visualization:** The process of representing data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps.
- **Business Task:** A specific task or goal that a business is trying to achieve.
- **Metric:** A measurable value that is used to track progress towards a business task.
- **Hypothesis:** A theory or idea that is being tested with data.
- **Data Viz:** Short for data visualization.
- **Search Trend Score:** A measure of how often a particular search term is used over time.

# Review a slide presentation

You have started learning how to create effective slide presentations to share your findings. In this reading, you’ll develop a rubric to help you evaluate slide presentations. By the end of this reading, you will have a stronger understanding of how to create an effective slide presentation using best practices from this course. This will help you evaluate your own work.

## Your evaluation criteria

When exploring a slide presentation, use your knowledge of effective presentation practices to evaluate it. This includes reviewing your own work! When you’re checking over slide presentations, there are some best practices you can check for:

- **Include a title, subtitle, and date:** Making sure that your slide deck presentation has a title, subtitle, and date makes sure that your audience knows exactly what you are presenting and when the information was from. That way they know it’s relevant and current to them!
- **Use a logical sequence of slides:** Organizing your slides in an order that makes sense guides your audience through your narrative, building understanding step by step.
- **Provide an agenda with a timeline:** An agenda offers a roadmap of your presentation, allowing your audience to follow along and anticipate key topics.
- **Limit the amount of text on slides:** Keeping text brief ensures clarity and retains the audience’s attention; aim for your audience to scan it within 5 seconds.
- **Start with the business task:** By immediately relating the content to the business task at hand, you contextualize your information, making it relevant and actionable.
- **Establish the initial hypothesis:** Presenting an initial hypothesis gives your audience a starting point for what to expect and frames the subsequent analysis.
- **Show what business metrics you used:** Clarifying which metrics you're analyzing validates your arguments and helps the audience gauge your presentation's relevance to business outcomes.
- **Use visualizations:** Visual aids can illustrate complex data more effectively than text alone, making your message more accessible.
- **Introduce the graphic by name:** A brief introduction to each graphic aids in understanding and retaining information.
- **Provide a title for each graph:** Titles act as signposts, helping the audience quickly grasp the meaning of each visual.
- **Go from the general to the specific:** Starting with a broad overview before diving into details ensures that all audience members are on the same page.
- **Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points:** Notes act as your cue cards, enabling a smoother delivery and ensuring no critical point is missed.
- **Include key takeaways:** Summarizing the main points at the end of your presentation reinforces the message and ensures the audience leaves with the intended takeaways.

Like so many parts of your job as a data professional, creating presentations is an iterative process. Reviewing your work, making changes as needed, and improving it when you can will make your presentations clearer and more useful for stakeholders.

## Create an evaluation table

Now that you have an understanding of what best practices you are trying to apply to slide presentations, organize your reviews using an evaluation table. An evaluation table essentially gives you a checklist for each slide in a presentation so you can identify any changes that need to be made in an organized fashion. The evaluation table should have a column for the slide number, a column for you to take notes on what worked well, and a column for what could be improved. Here’s an example of a blank evaluation table:

You can use evaluation tables to note things you liked about a presentation as well as things you would like to improve!

## Key takeaways

Refining your skills in evaluating slide decks is an evolving journey. Each aspect of your presentation—from a concise title to a coherent sequence of content, and the conciseness of your text to the accuracy of your visuals—is intentionally designed to elevate the audience's understanding and interest. Documenting your progress and taking time for reflection supports your development and is fundamental to communicating complex data in a clear, impactful narrative. And to improve your presentation skills for the future!

# Step-by-Step: Critique of a presentation

This reading provides an orientation of two upcoming videos:

- **Connor: Messy example of a data presentation**
- **Connor: Good example of a data presentation**

To get the most out of these videos, you should watch them together (back to back). In the first video, Connor introduces a presentation that is confusing and hard to follow. In the second video, he returns to talk about what can be done to improve it and help the audience better understand the data and conclusions being shared.

## Messy data presentation

In the first video, watch and listen carefully for the specific reasons the “messy” presentation falls short. Here is a preview:

- No story or logical flow
- No titles
- Too much text
- Inconsistent format (no theme)
- No recommendation or conclusion at the end

### **Messy presentation: people don’t know where to focus their attention**

The main problem with the messy presentation is the lack of a logical flow. Notice also how the data visualizations are hard to understand and appear without any introduction or explanation. The audience has no sense of what they are looking at and why.  When people in the audience have to figure out what the data means without any help, they can end up being lost, confused, and unclear about any actions they need to take.

## Good data presentation

In the second video, numerous best practices are applied to create a better presentation on the same topic. This “good” presentation is so much easier to understand than the messy one! Here is a preview:

- Title and date the presentation was last updated
- Flow or table of contents
- Transition slides
- Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme)
- Animated bullet points
- Annotations on top of visuals
- Logic and progression
- Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data can’t tell you

**Tip:** As you watch this video, take notes about what Connor suggests to create a good presentation. You can keep these notes in your journal. When you create your own presentations, refer back to your notes. This will help you to develop your own thinking about the quality of presentations.

### **Good presentation: people are logically guided through the data**

The good presentation logically guides the audience through the data – from the objectives at the beginning all the way to the conclusions at the end. Notice how the data visualizations are introduced using a common theme and are thoughtfully placed before each conclusion. A good presentation gives people in the audience the facts and data, helps them understand what the data means, and provides takeaways about how they can use their understanding to make a change or do some good.
