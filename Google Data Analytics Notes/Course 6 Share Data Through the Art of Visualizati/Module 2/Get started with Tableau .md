# Visualizations in spreadsheets and Tableau

This reading summarizes the seven primary chart types: column, line, pie, horizontal bar, area, scatter, and combo. Then, it describes how visualizations in spreadsheets compare to those in Tableau.

## Primary chart types in spreadsheets

In spreadsheets, **charts** are graphical representations of data from one or more sheets. Although there are many variations to choose from, we will focus on the most broadly applicable charts to give you a sense of what is possible in a spreadsheet. As you review these examples, keep in mind that these are meant to give you an overview of visualizations rather than a detailed tutorial. Another reading in this program will describe the applicable steps and process to create a chart more specifically. When you are in an application, you can always select **Help** from the menu bar for more information.

- To create a chart In Google Sheets, select the data cells, click **Insert** from the main menu, and then select **Chart**. You can set up and customize the chart in the dialog box on the right.
- To create a chart in Microsoft Excel, select the data cells, click **Insert** from the main menu, and then select the chart type. Tip: You can optionally click **Recommended Charts** to view Excel’s recommendations for the data you selected and then select the chart you like from those shown.

These are the primary chart types available:

- **Column (vertical bar)**: a column chart allows you to display and compare multiple categories of data by their values.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bhttENx_ToCbbRDcf_6AnA_a3eda9be6caa4e1c9f0a40f099571b40_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-4.50.44-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=LR3ogI-0AUC6848DQ5Fj0QfWGzgDFo96ncG3Hxr0hn8)

- **Line**: a line chart showcases trends in your data over a period of time. The last line chart example is a combo chart which can include a line chart. Refer to the description for the combo chart type.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wjw42RJXT4e8ONkSVw-HGA_22efe94ba0774eebb8bcd4c44f2e18d5_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-5.43.25-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=SVsADzydbEHwcr9s8Nu8x4InprLex9lPLdLm3f8DjPg)

- **Pie**: a pie chart is an easy way to visualize what proportion of the whole each data point represents.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lvzCpvu6SHG8wqb7ughxIg_d77eac61c2424b94b8c1700f040e1b13_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-5.44.04-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=wblbGCjZotxnQ0JFTaL3_enb112uRz2RUpfaEm3qolQ)

- **Horizontal bar**: a bar chart functions similarly to a column chart, but is flipped horizontally.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GTe0_mMVSTu3tP5jFYk7_g_6b8358837acb4f2e9b84a7b7cb7b5e66_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-5.44.34-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=oh1lvAMyTCj9j_Oxy8Qwg7PPKdGHi9kNaB5PxOeKldQ)

- **Area**: area charts allow you to track changes in value across multiple categories of data.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/APUvVGCsR8y1L1RgrJfMdA_abd661517c4145de9e1a2b60322a7be9_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-5.45.14-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=Xhdw_JG0xT9YvUfwtLoubykQJ5snSVmqFrsX2JGIgmA)

- **Scatter**: scatterplots are typically used to display trends in numeric data.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/UVQbZpg-Rj6UG2aYPsY-Mg_db28b59319d1403d9e0b8507a7eedf65_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-5.45.43-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=FN0vgGR4Q605qgsq01eCtdFPORHHYjKxsz-nNrBtZ6s)

- **Combo**: combo charts use multiple visual markers like columns and lines to showcase different aspects of the data in one visualization. The example below is a combo chart that has a column and line chart together.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/HN2Ufut2RQ2dlH7rdsUNFg_b4db76c2660940faa2b886356ec91cbf_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-5.46.10-PM.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=kUuSkK3_rudqmMf2-4rlAD8px4SatbRNRZuGeJ1BDi0)

## How visualizations differ in Tableau

As you have also learned, Tableau is an analytics platform that helps data analysts display and understand data. Most if not all of the charts that you can create in spreadsheets are available in Tableau. But, Tableau offers some distinct charts that aren’t available in spreadsheets. These are handy guides to help you select chart types in Tableau:

- [Which chart or graph is right for you?](http://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/media/which_chart_v6_final_0.pdf) This presentation covers 13 of the most popular charts in Tableau.
- [The Ultimate Cheat Sheet on Tableau Charts](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-on-tableau-charts-642bca94dde5). This blog describes 24 chart variations in Tableau and guidelines for use.

## Types of visualizations in Tableau

In addition to more traditional charts, Tableau also offers some more specific visualizations that you can use in your dashboard design:

- **Highlight tables** appear like tables with conditional formatting. Review the [steps to build a highlight table](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm).
- **Heat maps** show intensity or concentrations in the data. Review the [steps to build a heat map](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm).
- **Density maps** illustrate concentrations (such as a population density map). Refer to [instructions to create a heat map for density](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_howto_heatmap.htm).
- **Gantt charts** demonstrate the duration of events or activities on a timeline. Review the [steps to build a Gantt chart](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_gantt.htm).
- **Symbol maps** display a mark over a given longitude and latitude. Learn more from this [example of a symbol map](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/08/18/tableau-essentials-chart-types-symbol-map/).
- **Filled maps** are maps with areas colored based on a measurement or dimension. Explore an [example of a filled map](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/09/23/tableau-essentials-chart-types-filled-map/).
- **Circle views** show comparative strength in data. Learn more from this [example of a circle view](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/10/17/tableau-essentials-chart-types-circle-view/).
- **Box plots**, also known as **box and whisker charts,** illustrate the distribution of values along a chart axis. Refer to the [steps to build a box plot](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_boxplot.htm).
- **Bullet graphs** compare a primary measure with another and can be used instead of dial gauge charts. Review the [steps to build a bullet graph](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/qs_bullet_graphs.htm).
- **Packed bubble charts** display data in clustered circles. Review the [steps to build a packed bubble chart](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_bubbles.htm).

4. When you select **Create a Viz,** Tableau may open the **Connect to Data** dialog box. If so, select the **Files** tab and upload the CO2 dataset you downloaded earlier.

If selecting **Create a Viz** does not open the **Connect to Data** dialog box, in the Tableau Public interface, select the **Data** tab and then **New Data Source.** Upload the CO2 dataset.

5. After you upload the data, notice the list of data connections and sheets beside the main **Data-Source Interface.** The data connection is the CO2 dataset you’ve connected. It contains eight sheets, including one labeled CO2 Data Cleaned.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/FNpdiZnlRAyVps8bzU7Rsg_1fd6bd04df9845ffaf02b8addaf87cf1_Vf5aXn8l2KYPZpnnWkjUr9YJHSozE7mcseaNy-TlVdP3crvQngueoUfnJMKbGMn-9jFpzgAzXCGXXYu0M89Ti6nmZQL_v68o6lSy0EsTG9tmM8cn8ukss2NlsKd8FperkrxDtqc_RBcyWR-tneDVEKw?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=3Fajkt8iTm4RMwv7AoVnGX--EHc7qVz0GIB7yecSHJw)

6. Double-click on the sheet **CO2 Data Cleaned** to load that sheet's data into the main part (canvas) of the Tableau Public page. Alternatively, drag and drop the sheet onto the canvas where it says **Drag tables here.**

**Note:** Loading a sheet twice may cause you to inadvertently create a table relationship between the loaded sheets (similar to joining tables in SQL). You’ll explore this later in the course. For now, if you do this accidentally, don’t worry! Just right-click on the second box to remove it from the table listings.

A dotted line with a warning symbol connects the two. The down arrow in the right of CO2 data cleaned 1 field has been selected, which opens a menu with the following choices: Open, Rename, Reset Table Name, Swap with root (CO2 Data Cleaned), Remove, Field names are in first row, Generate field names automatically. The Remove option is highlighted.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/2Bv7ezk5TRyynfDMqcTLWQ_b979acfbb45341a297a600e26c751bf1_Sg60SZNYyHxBjH7Aeaa38AeVkuNADAGAe3BfkF48Ab94vjSrAJW7tMGmf5wNA9HlYow3iWNX4VSm_KDv5T0B2R3LIPTDcqiw6L8The9TKE4fZxBz8yj_X9RFjf0qQ4NySEGrfIfi7JKQEl7XFEbjclc?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=Ciy18VcPuswPxlWbn7HG5FL7A7Xu8OMiYayj3_-pzJQ)

7. When the sheet is loaded, Tableau displays the table schema with the field names, data types, etc. Select the **Update Now** button to bring up the first 100 rows in the table; you can increase the number of rows in the settings above the data view. In the following image, the number of rows displayed has been increased to 1,000.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tXx3tdTCRQmeOdnBRuYUdg_d3ccdda986034ac5b7c3e840d7dcc7f1_722d9-JrsoEcGQmjv_7D4pmdkf3rKyp_5PFBKtFHiPn7s7MiyPXwGvQhcTkeJriA_p4qCzTaQLuBnuigQUFVkNyEh1eilcQeV7HtanBX2yZQKm5AhmPWgAutqxgCnz8WwPfHyLrK8UQ5UmW7iU4C2yc?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=z4J6sqfnBmi8PCs-_fvj1TypPOzwtMgUtUbnGFxF_QU)

Each row corresponds to a single data point, and each column represents a different feature.

Tableau automatically interprets the type of data in each column and  displays the following icons above the column names, to indicate how Tableau has interpreted the data in the column:

- **#:** Numeric data
- **Abc:** String data
- **Globe:** Geographic data
- **Calendar:** Date data
- **Calendar:** Date and time data

In the previous image, Tableau has interpreted the first two columns as geographic data, the third column as string data, and the last three columns as numeric data.

# **Step 3: Access your data in Tableau**

Now that you have all of your data loaded into Tableau, you can use it to create a visualization in which the CO2 emissions are displayed per country.

Select the **Sheet 1** tab to open the **New workbook** pane in the display.

## 

# **Step 4: Understand dimensions and measures**

The **Data** pane in the side bar displays column names in a list. In Tableau and most business intelligence software, you will find two types of data elements: **dimensions** and **measures.** According to the [Tableau documentation](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_typesandroles.htm):

- Dimensions contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data). You can use dimensions to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view.
- Measures contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure. Measures can be aggregated. When you drag a measure into the view, Tableau applies an aggregation to that measure (by default).

In the **Data** pane of the Tableau side bar, you’ll see dimensions listed above the gray line and measures below the gray line (under **Measure Names**). These allow you to build and customize charts.

# **Step 5: Create a visualization chart of CO2 emissions**

Now, create a chart that displays the CO2 emissions per country. In the **Data** pane of the sidebar, double-click the **Country Name** dimension. The canvas displays a map of the countries with points indicating which countries are represented in the data.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jzdzHfP3QBGXmtd5_drM_g_ad332d76ee6147fa9022d83b87aa1ef1_mI16ZF3h-icLiQHPkpDDaMFu1CO9Zz4t4tsj02lCJb_Y1fHfx4loFdubKtiz6HwTzYCLvvlArLED8EqUxE3GurxOooXHUOJOPS8oaUBtH1LnyLV9iDaZqNWSWA0UnH8SlCiOjonyL-00DRT82v6lLiE?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=92FuGW0EKaixUyWUIMWdPqw7YbfVfpfU1CrkxoHr57A)

The points are all the same size because, if there is no measure selected, Tableau defaults to scale each country equally. If you want to scale point size by kilotons (kt) of CO2 emissions, you need to include a specific measure.

To do this, double-click (or drag and drop onto the sheet) the **measure CO2 (kt)** in the **Data** pane. This changes the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted, as in the example below.

There is a callout box around CO2 (kt). The world map now displays a dot marker on each country, but the point vary in size based on each country’s CO2 emissions.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/43jFKlTzR1S-AiSDdWkxgg_63374ac5a92f40d1b51039237377faf1_ct6xsLvR63m0hXSOvr7SxgX70S5poZ_WXVwCoUxhS5CAKlJEiOVyczhba4cShRXFPjcGDFoOleGU0S0_cSvoPdtasIh70ESO6edTcCH_Y87XEMzPqSm2PGaJMWeSZ8gZ29E5UjwAx6WC85EckTpL56U?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=2KGEELlPGD211E26r5vcmA3Xu6AG2unLN8U8vcmJ0NU)

Tableau has a wide selection of options for depicting the measure of a given dimension. Most of these options are contained in the **Marks** card, **Filter** shelf, and **Page** shelf.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/W_oOUKY8SfGPCSlAjK0D8g_9ba36a9204fa42a2ac34ce79aa7180f1_j3FLj7QrfTYhLc-DZ7HuO9ZWOty2WZJbkw3k8vADNDNVis2nHemh8Xaj0fxqSbfLY4Fv6vmJfNaU1Log_IKgu4vstqWTq-0ZzGSPBxog3vj9993CRq1osnjR9oMlxewWp0jblEAgxRCm2rp6AV1Htx8?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=lmBFxU3NcQr1DROZpxIANzwUYGggb4JiwlT8Mm_6STk)

## 

# **Step 6: Customize your chart's dimensions and measures**

If you drag and drop a measure on one of the option classes, such as Color, Size, or Label, you can change that aspect of the measure’s visualization on the chart.

For example, if you want to change the color of the CO2 measure, drag the measure **CO2 (kt)** from the sidebar to the **Marks** card and drop it on the **Color** box. This will change the measure’s configuration to a color breakdown. Then, select the **Color** box in the **Marks** card to pull up a menu for changing the color and its options. To change the color, select the **Edit Colors** button.

Try out the different options available. You can always reverse a change by selecting the **Back** arrow button in the toolbar or using your computer's default undo keyboard shortcut. Similarly, you can redo changes you make by selecting the **Forward** arrow button.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nz9nrah3RnGLRyxRebcwQw_48fc4d8f0dc74b90ac9e71ccda8558f1_BJJDNCpyNOqIxuv7d2G1C-gQFZzd-h7CcT5QOxgT78Qy_n7zRdYov2qwdjWPpRGhcSSmiLcAvEsZynE5lZ1hti9M4oLSEYqtKUbmcyvRCHEUFmr-PWYGQ__2HDijzd6wNh4oUatbPR9dj8fM7ZDbhUY?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=RFrCS4K51D-ptQTrnhfilCTAOyi9qx-XAMdmAblspIQ)

### Change dimensions and measures

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/w98wEsM3RyKloBNkSryf_g_5f7f408e4e824af8ac8e8b25867df0f1_EH-tC69p0tBUFdsKBMN-JJYJEY2v2XDiX3Q11KdLpflcZxOQKMy83ory7GPwWTLeva0jpbL4-OaydsLIbBY1wEWxt2SAUWoA2YmqflhmEukA4hZTuv_kDbXT1Wnfaii1WQXJwG8ePJxnBUkitVBpnZA?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=OWK85wN2IU24cRYBHdJnk5ZRC_v4XrkYgEnXX-lueNc)

Changing either the dimension or the measure on a chart is simple. Suppose that, instead of visualizing the CO2 per country, you want to chart the CO2 per capita per region. To do this, in the sidebar, double-click on the dimension **Region.** Then double-click on  the measure **CO2 Per Capita.** This will result in seven world charts: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Just below this, under measure names, there is a callout box around CO2 per capita in metric tons.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CskoDYCsQharfZIcTy287Q_307e3812e0c14ed9905ebb2c3f0379f1_Q5gp0kr_i8ukHSZZkd70cgqwT7qf1hGjILtM61x2Y3Zs_vR90HbQ4PvZl_jBcJ5-2K9zLgglI1miyAwIQIA8mV75eEiju3MgLgl_fDnVKIy3BQRiGUiHk_UVBmEjuZcZoqkaaxwQjjiGJvVH7h7lUVE?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=N7d11gSMaxOH0MbPtk-64FxDI7fbdy5EigVnX8DYimY)

# **Step 7: Customize your chart's title**

Currently, the title of this chart is **Sheet 1.** To give the chart a more descriptive title:

1. Point to the title box, select the dropdown list menu, and then select **Edit Title** to open the **Edit Title** dialog box. (You can also double-click **Sheet 1** to open the **Edit Title** dialog box where you can change the title.)

The menu includes options to Edit Title, Reset Title, Hide Title, and Format Title. Edit Title is highlighted.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/R01kCNWRS1Oc1FBVXYY5ag_f62e27e90fe94931b58e8c5a49dd20f1_IQ2NUx8wNT3H-dATD7ng2m6mLPN1RLvlLButWO8grc8kODaqTv5qUV3RVCP_Vt1F0EPhbXZ6biafNKQUf7tpKUKDYcM6dD0z-sH-_KMsg4KFu5hkadHq10L-lhYYsMM5ODix3TykCVT0Uaf5LthJoI0?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=d7xIkDMPCJyrkIsqQnAHIqupRUulLvRPVpmxKZyGJVQ)

2. Enter any title you wish and select **OK.** A descriptive title helps people understand what the chart visual seeks to convey. For example, you could title this chart “CO2 Per Capita by Region.”

You can also choose to insert an object, or clear formatting. CO2 Per Capita by Region has been typed into the title field. Below four buttons allow you to Reset, Apply, Cancel, or OK

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0kK4nt1ZQp22qFUfggvYmg_bf71f15cf55243ee8b831eff5470cdf1_vXgR4FGiMmak2M-HAin8SSAO5qLBKS-FHl4B0HnbW-PSz2Ix2I5GqXT01RF0niSI__Vew5GhIAjNpOwo_HToi6OtpVEPpx39CMcSH1BrYMGKdKCgLiGPRBP7mPmK_HasIbR_oBFCAWk7xyDNfvvoGuI?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=zVN_oNkl6aZT3u_xIywEq22u3aKK4FLFV3a5qE2jdZQ)

## 

# **Step 8: Delete a chart or sheet**

### Delete a chart

To delete a chart from the sheet, select the **Clear Sheet** button in the toolbar.

On this same dropdown menu, the clear formatting option is greyed out.]

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9QRVI46yRMSqK5X1hZ4iww_e8de76de371b41e8b44946f497a763f1_SDeOWqvPY9-lzQTbCD-WBrFKfjMegTl9-V9DQQap4Yx2PQ1kTv5S-QmPu1To5ZOcG-M7aX0k3yRpTKu5TO7_xa8tbA2AxCfotRRFMv-8Qosuyq_eDypOy6QFxKij9UKoRqAFsTY9ztdfrq8vmK54JGs?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=bjB4iAlc2vFWCVlw8-G03bbJ8yGKpuWIYHxzS-og-hk)

This will completely delete the chart and bring you back to an empty sheet.

**Note:** This will not remove the sheet title.

If you delete a chart by accident or change your mind, select the **Back** button to undo the deletion.

### Delete a sheet

If you want to delete a sheet in its entirety, right-click on the sheet's tab at the bottom of the screen and select **Delete.** You won’t be able to delete a sheet if it is the only sheet in your file.

**Note:** Unlike clearing a sheet, deleting a sheet altogether cannot be reversed!

Menu choices include New Worksheet, New Dashboard, New Story, Duplicate, Duplicate as Crosstab, Rename, Delete, Hide All Sheets, Unhide All Sheets, Publish, and Color.

[](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wt30bY1uSnSdwPW72SbcBg_3229ae18a58e4daf80af2b20683dbef1_5CbJrOJoKyJsmN8cUg68dnl9D0kZTzhmVOFTbmOQVqPKKkwDOSG4nkTF_G6uBEogD55eS6S222IV-Ilc2QeHXZbkkNDBJ66IULYgbt39k4d0GOEjkt118SDVUUqHfMIyM_6_SdvU-JL0c4y6bURCfbw?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=0_zXTJH2Hw_ypqRjGChJcBHU43vZN76YvXUB5CxHPJs)

The skills you’ve practiced in this hands-on activity will help you get started visualizing your data. This is far from the end of the story, though. As you progress through this course, you’ll continue refining your Tableau skills.

# Using Tableau Desktop

You have started exploring Tableau as a data visualization tool in business intelligence dashboards to convey insights with stakeholders. Throughout this program, you will continue to use and access Tableau—eventually using it to create your own dashboards. This reading will enable you to familiarize yourself with Tableau's interface and functionality.

## Create a profile on Tableau Public****

With Tableau Public, you can create and share visualizations. If you don’t already have an account, make one on the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) site. Note that trying to make an account from the main page will sign you up for a Tableau Free Trial rather than a Tableau Public account.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gbhu2gr3RSSpLAelETxUNw_fb691af041a24066be0ac29072bf53f1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=ve1dmsut6v_sKtu5GYym_zBq7ufvQFc3sBavKg1Wi9E)

The difference between these two options is that a Free Trial lasts for 14 days, whereas Tableau Public gives you long-term access through the web version of the program. It has some limitations compared to the other versions of Tableau, but it is free to use and will enable you to complete the upcoming activities. You can also use your Tableau credentials to access Tableau Public if you already have an account! You are welcome to try the free trial or purchase Tableau, but it is not required for this program.

Complete the information in the signup form. When you click the **Create My Profile** button, you’ll be transferred to your profile page. This is where your Tableau Public visualizations can be made public to share with your peers. In the tabs on this page, you can access lists of visualizations you’ve made, visualizations you’ve favorited, authors you are following, and authors who are following you. By clicking **Edit Profile,** you can add additional information like your bio, title, organization, and links to social media accounts. This is also where you can enable Tableau Public’s **Hire Me** button. The **Hire Me** button will indicate to potential hiring managers that your Tableau skills are available for hire.

## Optional: Download the desktop version

With the desktop application, you can use features from Tableau Public without connecting to the internet. It is free to use, just like Tableau Public’s online version. Keep in mind that this application cannot be used on the Chromebook operating system and is not required for this course. If you are using Windows or Mac OS, this desktop application will enable you to complete upcoming activities that use Tableau Public. To download [Tableau Public Desktop Edition](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download) (this is optional), log into your account and review the [system requirements](https://www.tableau.com/products/techspecs#public) for your operating system.

## Loading and linking data

Tableau enables you to load in your own data and link it to other datasets directly in the platform. When you log in, choose to **Create a Viz.** This will open a new worksheet where you can upload data or connect to online sources, such as your Google Drive.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ceZcQhOVSS6Wi4m0fMO3qA_4cce7d8748c746efb757b1e101cc6ef1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=qnogDMyVqcJM0inDfYPogSYRlblCUMpIDGmuLHw8iLs)

Once you upload data to your worksheet, it will populate the Connections pane.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/KbdZNSq2TvO0k9yVVAka6w_8af102c3493942f48084a0519cb0d1f1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=L7Rhl9718wS86CICTYxz7KJF-bSQfcAmU1DvitEPqMY)

You can add more connections to other data sources in order to build visualizations that compare different datasets. Simply drag and drop tables from the Sheets section in order to join tables and generate those connections:

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/3Ix-T0UATaie-SMxpMp7Mw_6bac86461d5248a5a5d0ad79556042f1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=2c9ziwh70AbFp_Tcc9-uG4jgVfAN0HjDPgnaMXZ02Dw)

## Dimensions and measures

Tableau uses dimensions and measures to generate customized charts. For example, check out this chart focusing on CO2 emissions per country. The Country Name dimension can be used to show a map of the countries on the planet with dots indicating which countries are represented in the data.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hHfhiTWSQWWXxqOmAl-oug_8951c3d6d391470db42d47f8534eb9f1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=1-6vPZGvefEc2AWoe4fnoX0mL5UkxV4bQ-1eLlP2OMg)

The dots are all the same size because—with no measure selected—Tableau defaults to scale each country equally. If you want to scale by CO2 emissions, you need to include a specific measure. Here is the same chart with a measure for CO2 kiloton (kt). This changes the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted:

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vy0F57dkT6m_ISeXYni9BQ_7599fda50a3b4073bad2cbb15cc8acf1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=4KwZ2TE1SmrEjU9v1-vPtI01oBZBQ0lT9nd-PLTTPTE)

Tableau has a wide variety of options for depicting the measure for a given dimension. Most of these options are contained near the main display and the column with dimensions and measures.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/aCCo-k5QRweLK7_OGYetlA_ea86b64d1a4e4dd7b7fac2ca031c34f1_image.png?expiry=1717027200000&hmac=ENVl0mAFE_dZx-dTDmKYRTABSVQXDnWeWx5MPHNqV8U)

## Key takeaways

Tableau allows you to customize measures with options such as Color, Size, and Label, which change those aspects of the measure’s visualization on the chart. As you customize measures in Tableau, you will want to consider accessibility for your audience. As a refresher, you can check out [this video on accessible visualizations from the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data/lecture/yVjKD/accessible-visualizations)
